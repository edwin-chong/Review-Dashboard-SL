2,2,5,2024-06-15,"I would like to sincerely compliment the amazing set of staff from Burnt Ends! The service rendered to me was out of this world.  I would like to particularly compliment Edwin. His service was over and above the rest. He was very welcoming, efficient and extremely helpful. He continuously kept checking on our food, drinks and comfort. Employees like him should be recognized for rendering such top quality service from their hearts. He took pride in his work. He is definitely an asset to the company.  In addition to that, Suresh, Jimmy, Louis and Joshua Pereira were also very efficient, hospitable and helpful. Thanks to this wonderful set of staff , we truly enjoyed our experience with your restaurant and am definitely visiting it again.  Once again, thank you Burnt Ends for the memorable experience.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
3,3,4,2024-06-13,"- Great concept, excellent food, but very pushy staff - If you go to Burnt Ends you can expect like a high class BBQ experience. And most dishes fully meet the even high expectations. The beef and uni was just okay - the cream was too intense, so the beef was barely present. The eggplant miso and the beef kofta were really great. The Smokey flavors, well balanced, nice level of spiciness. But the absolute highlight in my opinion was the beef marmalade and pickles as well as the pulled pork burger. Both were rich, savory, and delicious. Would order them again any time. The steaks (flank steak and blackmore striploin) were really good - perfectly grilled. However, I‚Äôd rather forgo the marrow sauce. The drinks were good as well. The wine list was a bit overpriced given the quality of the wines offered, but the cocktails were good. I can recommend the cucumber smash and the Margarita. But there is one thing, I didn‚Äôt like about this place: the service staff is friendly and nice,  it quite pushy. We had almost no break between the dishes and as we weren‚Äôt sure about whether to have dessert, we were asked 6 times. That‚Äôs too much in my opinion. We felt rushed. And given the ambition and high end cuisine of this place, I expect a bit more reticent behavior of the service. Maybe next time. Still would come back.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

5,5,4,2024-06-10,Food was good and services within the restaurant were positive - constantly checking in on you and offering suggestions. Booking table services on the other hand wasn‚Äôt good - they had made mistakes on availabilities when the place wasn‚Äôt crowded.,Burnt Ends Restaurant

12,12,3,2024-06-15,Good service/environment. Dishes were very subpar; most failed to stand out. Quail eggs had right texture but insufficient smokiness. Chicken was the only dish where the flavour was brought out.,Burnt Ends Restaurant

14,14,5,2024-06-01,"Ate at this restaurant, wow. Once I found out I was coming to Singapore, this restaurant has been on my list. I made a reservation (got to give your CC#  (for 12 noon).  The door that is marked is the Bar, look to the left and its a tall door near the other end with writing on it, but not the name.  From the moment I walked in the door, there was someone taking care of me, stored my umbrella, stored my jacket, gave me a menu, water and advice on what to order. Got to see the transition from checking their phones to being a well run brigade.  You could feel the heat coming off the ovens and flames. I watched the chefs set my plates up in front of me, then a waiter carried it around and placed it in front of me, and explained the food. They gave me 3 apps for free, nice service.  This is not a cheap dinner, but it was awesome",Burnt Ends Restaurant

16,16,4,2024-06-01,"Managed to secure a spot at the bar within a couple of months. We decided to eat the set menu. Unfortunately the set menu didn't encompass the cheeseburger so added that on. Glad we did as it was restraunt quality. Found the experience to be wonderful and great service with ambience. Nice little touch was the fact the staff recommended if we should eat the dish with just one bite.  First we ate the smoked quail egg with caviar. They did a great job of infusing the smoke into the egg the egg was chewy but caviar softened it. Perfect starter to set the tone for the evening  Next was the steak frites. Nice bite size that was crispy, light, fluffy and again the caviar was a great addition.  Crab and pork grill stickers. Al dente. Full of juice and flavour. Very neat item for the sitting.  Next was my favourite item of the evening. Duck Liver Parfait Tartlet. A runny centre housed in a soft pastry. The duck Liver accompanied with chocolate. Wonderful unfirmiliar and unforgettable combination. We ordered another round of this.  Next standout dish was was the beef marmalade and pickel. Stunning meal that was a tad tangy in a good way.  The rest of dishes being the Jamaican chicken, hazelnut leak, burnt end sanga and 2 desserts were a tad average which was unfortunate as the night started off brilliant.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

This place is worth every single dollar, the most delicious food, the most amazing and friendly service with even a head chef who makes time to chat with customers. By far the besttttttt meal, best entrees, best steak I have ever had, perfect meal, soooooooooo clean and you can watch them prepare it!!

The surface is caramelized and crispy An unexpected surprise is the addition of tangerine peel to provide a fresh aroma and balance the sweetness. I originally thought it was just roasted marshmallows, but it exceeded my expectations. üî∏Crispy Pig‚Äôs Ear and Lardo: The bottom is shortbread made of pig ears and flour, full of aroma Spread a thin layer of pork neck fat to make it round, smooth and smooth Sprinkle with black and white sesame seeds and cumin to further enhance the level  ""not bad"" üî∏Grissini and TaramasalataÔºö Italian sticks with salted fish roe, fresh cream, chives and radish The taste is heavy and salty, suitable for pairing with wine üî∏Taliwang Chicken Kofta: The bottom is Indian naan, and the chicken meatballs in the middle are mixed with Taliwang, and the flavor is similar to Indian curry. üî∏SNICKERS Bar: Chocolate bars drizzled with caramel sauce, sprinkled with peanuts, served with peanut ice cream Exquisite version of Snicker, you will feel familiar as soon as you eat it  ‚ÄúNormal and delicious‚Äù üî∏Japanese A5 Miyazaki StriploinÔºö Nearly 5 minutes cooked, the skin is not crispy yet It has a lot of fat and tastes very greasy. What‚Äôs most pity is that some of the pieces are sticky. The side salad is sour and enjoyable, and has an excellent anti-greasy effect. üî∏Burnt Ends Sanger: Hidden dishes not on the menu The bread is soft and elastic, with cabbage and spicy sauce in the middle. Replacing the common hamburger meat with pulled pork, but it also resulted in a slightly awkward feeling.  The atmosphere and environment are very comfortable, more like a bar than a restaurant The food portion is small, but it can be easily eaten as a late night snack or a second meal And there is no low consumption. It is very flexible which is a big advantage. Dishes require some ingenuity and memory points It‚Äôs different from other barbecue restaurants where you‚Äôll find a straight-ball showdown. Delicacy can be seen everywhere, creating a sense of contrast.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
20,20,5,2024-06-01,Perfect and excellent from start to finish. Service was helpful and attentive and genuinely interested in helping me make the best menu choices. I wanted a variety of flavors and experiences but a small volume of food and they found me a nice small steak and some single-serve versions of some of their best starters. On top of that an excellent cocktail and a delicious Shiraz. Thank you!,Burnt Ends Restaurant

22,22,4,2024-05-25,"As it turns out, more of a tapas place than a steakhouse: dishes are tiny and you'll need to order a bunch for your meal. I am not sure why they decided to mostly exclude carbs from the menu - aside from the (delicious) sour dough bread, there's no fries, pastas, etc to go with your steak. While individual dishes aren't expensive, having to order so many quickly adds up, and on top of that we paid a $6 charge per pax for water.  Food is otherwise delicious, steak was top notch, cocktails were tasty and strong, and the service is excellent, but for the price and the quantities you get there are better places.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
23,23,3,2024-05-25,"It‚Äôs no secret that this place has been hyped for years and I did come in with some level of expectation. And therefore this garners a 3 star review because nothing was outstanding. The flavours didn‚Äôt meld together and think the cooking was just alright. For example, the whites of the quail egg were rubbery. Their signature beef & uni was underwhelming. Felt like 2 expensive components in a dish without any harmony. Everything was extremely rich, lacking balance. And all the dishes also lacked texture. Smoked flavours were done well though.  I think burnt end‚Äôs accolades and reputation did influence this review. But for the price, I also expect more",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Being seated right at the kitchen felt like a dream come true ‚Äì watching those chefs work their magic was like dinner and a show rolled into one! The food? Pure perfection. Each bite of that heavenly steak was like a taste of culinary heaven. And the service? Let's just say they made me feel like royalty. Definitely a great place to have a romantic night ‚Äì I can't wait to come back for seconds ‚Äì and thirds, and fourths! This place has officially stolen my heart.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

26,26,4,2024-05-25,"We arrived on a rainy night with much anticipation given how hard it was to get a table here! seated promptly and the quality of service was apparent immediately. Burnt ends offers an ale carte option or a chefs omakase. The omakase includes dishes not listed on the menu! We opted to pick our own and ordered the wagyu uni and miso egg plant to share. For snacks we tried the brown butter leeks and fennel with burrata. Then for mains we had the flat iron 150gm as recommended by our server which was very good but I could have done without the bone marrow; I thought it had a funny taste. Then moving on to the pi√®ce de r√©sistance we had the OP bone in 1.25kg  beast! An amazing piece cooked to perfection with the price tag to match!  All in all a great meal, no surprises that burnt ends does amazing steaks over charcoal but I would skip all the other bites and snacks!  Oh! The marshmallow was also surprisingly good!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

32,32,5,2024-06-15,"I had been trying to get a reservation at Burnt Ends for YEARS. By some stroke of luck, I managed to get a reservation. We had the following dishes: 1. Smoked egg caviar - Small and packs a punch. However, I won‚Äôt order this again at 18 a piece. 2. Chicken Neck - Highly recommended by the staff. It was sold out shortly. 3. Grissini & taramasalata - The leeks, hazelnut, and white truffle dish was a very good combination. 4. Chicken for 2 - The chefs took a while to cook this, and they had a lot of technique. I found the accompanying sauce a bit too sweet for me. 5. Beef - Dining companion had it. Thumbs up. 6. Berry Tart - Really good. It looked really simple and home made but very well done. Loved it! 7. Marshmallow - It was smoky and had a citrus taste to it. Good but you may want to skip this.  Total bill: 381 for 2 pax.  There‚Äôs alot of action going on when seated at the grill area. Tensions ran high, and alot of respect for the chefs who were putting their heart and sleeve into the food. You may find the grill area a little too warm. Another couple mentioned about the heat repeatedly, and they were shifted away after her third mention.  We ended off with some lovely doughnuts at the bakery with coffee. Highly recommend.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

38,38,4,2024-06-15,"Overall, the dining experience is not bad but due to the very high price point + it‚Äôs a Michelin one star, wouldn‚Äôt say all the dishes are that fantastic to justify the price tag. Some hits and misses in our opinion.  Highly Recommended: 1) their bone marrow bun is insanely good. The soft bun is soaked rich in the bone marrow and the taste is perfect. I have eaten one of the best bun in my life. 2) Cubano Pork belly goes very well with the salad. I really love it  Not bad: The 200g Striploin is great for sharing. The steak tastes good but not the best I have tasted in Sg.  Items are that pretty average or probably not worth the high price tag: maitake mushroom that is served with congee egg yolk probably is not something i would pay $32 for it. Uni toast tastes good but for $70 for that tiny size, probably won‚Äôt order it again. Berry tart dessert very normal.  Most dishes come in bite size or tapas version so I believe the wow factor needs to be there to really justify such price point. However the service is excellent. Most of them are knowledgeable and very polite which is something i would expect in such a restaurant.  However the temperature of the restaurant is a bit too warm for us. The spotlight heat is making the dining environment too warm and the air conditioning is not strong enough to cool the place well. I was sweating throughout the meal which makes it uncomfortable.  To conclude, after this dining experience, I don‚Äôt have strong urge to return anytime soon but I don‚Äôt mind coming back say once a year or once every two years for some special occasion.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

The kingfish was supposedly ‚Äúhalf cooked‚Äù but it was well done. The eggplant dish, half was salted and the other half had no salt. The fennel with Baratta tasted like nothing.  The most interesting dish was the pig ears which took a lot of technique to create, but was too salty. The ribeye was delicious, but that is the quality of the sourced meat with the marbling and less on technique.  I have been to chef Andre and it was like ‚Äúwoah‚Äù every single dish.

59,59,3,2024-04-16,"Finally managed to secure a reservation for lunch at Burnt Ends. Been wanting to try them out to see what the hype is about.  Overall I have to say I am very disappointed. The tapas that we ordered for starters was mediocre. Taste wise. It was ok. The only good ones were the white asparagus and lamb chops. The white asparagus tasted nice and fresh with the accompanying sauce complimenting it nicely. The lamb chops were tender and had just the right amount of gamey taste too it. Not too empowering but just enough to remind you that you are tasting lamb.  For main course. We went for the flat iron steak. The steak was cut before serving, but most of the slices were sliced too thin. It could be that the chef wanted it to be easier to chew as flat iron are known to be a bit on the chewy side. The steak was very greasy for me taste. As our table was facing the open kitchen. I noticed the chefs spraying oil onto the steaks on the grill quite regularly which might be the cause of the greasiness. Steak was a little underdone. Most of the meat were still quite rare.  After having tried Burnt Ends. Would I patronise them again. Most probably not. Sadly the hype is just hype. Food wise. I think I'll stick to Bedrock or Fat Cow for my steaks.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Whole night was trying to rush us to finish and kick us out because the next booking was a table of 10 instead of us 4! Such a drastic change from the first visit of the outlet in Keong Saik, overated and overhyped and please don't get the pull pork burger, it's dry and had a shredded paper texture which I ended up spitting out.

She didn‚Äôt even asked me to prepare any evidence I am flying to my home. Even in this my special circumstances this restaurant forfeited my deposit and didn‚Äôt suggest me any other option.

63,63,5,2024-04-16,"It was so incredibly difficult to get a reservation but we got lucky and scored a slot, likely because someone cancelled last minute.  We had the full tasting menu and some drinks so our bill for 2 pax came up to almost $1,000. Very pricey, might be the most expensive dinner I‚Äôve had in Singapore. My partner‚Äôs logic was that since it‚Äôs so hard to score a slot, might as well go all out.  The food was incredible and the chef frequently came over to check on our table, so we felt very well taken care of throughout our meal. There were many outstanding dishes, including the uni toast, A5 striploin and white pepper chicken neck.

71,71,2,2024-04-16,"1000% sure people come here for the gram.$700+ for 2pax to have some bbq food and wine is straight up robbery. 10/10 would not come back again, would rather invest a fraction of the money spent on a Weber grill or something.  The food is good, just nothing to scream and shout about and certainly not worth paying THAT much for. The problem is that it‚Äôs just good - no complexity, no flair, and just nothing standout about any of the dishes. I mean, a roasted marshmallow for dessert? Did the chefs at least try when they were coming up with the menu?  Like yes the Pakistani lamb chops were good. But I wouldn‚Äôt rate this place above the Tze Char across the road from my place. This has nothing on Kiln in Sydney, just to rate it against an equal benchmark.  Also, $38 for the two teeny tiny slices of kingfish (pictured, that tasted really fishy by the way) is just daylight robbery.  Also the service was good but lowkey annoying after awhile. Plus, one of the servers dropped some sauce on my husband‚Äôs shirt with left an oil stain. Like I said, annoying.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Full of rich flavor and umami. The sauces offered helped elevate the flavours to the next level.  The staff were the perfect balance of friendly, approachable and professional.

90,90,4,2024-03-17,"Burnt Ends offers straightforward fare with unpretentious dishes. However, it fell short of our expectations for Michelin star quality. The popular striploin proved a bit tough and chewy, and the smaller bite items were just mediocre at best. The highlights of our meal were undoubtedly the tender and crusty flat iron steak and the rich Pakistani lamb chop, complemented perfectly by a balanced curry. The complimentary berry tart dessert was a pleasant touch. We spent about $250 per person, and the meal left us quite full. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. A return visit to explore their other offerings, perhaps opting for the chef's selection, wouldn't be unwelcome.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
91,91,5,2024-03-17,"Burnt Ends in Singapore is a culinary gem that offers a unique and unforgettable dining experience. The moment you step inside, you‚Äôre greeted by the warm ambiance and the enticing aroma of wood-fired cooking. The open kitchen allows you to witness the magic as the chefs expertly prepare each dish with precision and flair.  The menu is a celebration of modern barbecue, with a focus on quality ingredients and innovative techniques. The signature Burnt Ends Sanger, with its tender pulled pork and tangy coleslaw, is a must-try. The beef marmalade and pickles are another standout, offering a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors.  What sets Burnt Ends apart is its extensive selection of Australian wines, including the highly sought-after Wendouree. This rare find is a testament to the restaurant‚Äôs commitment to offering an exceptional wine experience that perfectly complements the smoky and rich flavors of the food.  The service at Burnt Ends is attentive and knowledgeable, ensuring that every aspect of your meal is enjoyable. It‚Äôs not just a meal; it‚Äôs an experience where the passion for food and the art of cooking come together to create something truly special.

92,92,2,2024-03-17,"I was looking forward to my first visit to Burnt Ends and hoped to be impressed by the food but sorry to say that it was very underwhelming.  I felt like I was in a prank show, ‚Äúhey look at how people actually pay $18 for a single quail egg, so long as u sprinkle some caviar on top‚Äù. The quail egg was nice but ordinary.  Dish: Leek, Hazelnut and Black Truffle ‚ÄúDid you know, by shaving a few truffle slices on a piece of leek, you can charge $55 for it üòÄ‚Äù There‚Äôs really nothing special to the leek‚Ä¶ Also, I could smell the truffle but there‚Äôs oddly no taste to it  At $55 for a stalk of leek hoping it would be a pleasant surprise on humble ingredients like ‚Äúoh wow, amazing flavours, I get it‚Äù. But it was more ‚Äúoh, okay. Hmm‚Äù.  Dish: King Crab and Brown Garlic Butter I don‚Äôt know why it was so salty instead of fresh sweetness. I didn‚Äôt like the brown butter and ended up sweeping it aside  Dish: Grissini and Taramasalata The chives bread stick item, this one is not bad. Bread is light and crispy, topped with finely chopped chives and their special spread. Well executed  Dish: Crab and Pork sticker I liked this. Skin is thin and crisp, soaked in the crab oil as sauce  Dish: Beef Kofta Well seasoned, flavour reminds me of Turkish kebabs. But too heavy tasting for my liking  Dish: Blackmores‚Äô Striploin I enjoyed this, decent marbling with some char. The fresh greens on the side were nicely coated w some balsamic vinegar  It all just felt really over priced and quite a rip off.. I‚Äôd rather dine at other Michelin restaurants for the same price. E.g b√©ni, JAAN, just to name a couple that feels more worthwhile  The highlight was the ambience, loved the high ceilings and the warm woods interior",Burnt Ends Restaurant

The service and booze were fantastic, and the food was okay, but i could tell the focus is in the main dining hall where I wish I could have eaten their tasting menu.  Pictured is the delicious fries that were super crisp and lovely. I must admit I didn't keep photos of the meat cigar or tacos as the flavour wasn't quite up there for a top 50 venue.  With my minor criticism I'd still highly recommend heading to Burnt ends. It's truly a beautiful spot.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

107,107,4,2024-02-16,"Visited in Feb 2024  This was a long awaited visit to Burnt Ends after trying to get a reservation for almost a year. Liked the overall experience with many dishes which were pretty decent. There is a chef‚Äôs tasting menu for S$280-350 or you can order a-la-carte. We ordered a-la-carte and our per pax spend almost came to the same amount as the chef‚Äôs menu. But you may get to try more dishes with a-la-carte ordering. There are also dishes you can order which are not on the menu - ask the servers for non menu items which may interest you.  Among the 3 steak dishes we ordered, my preference was in the order of (1) roast picanha with chimichurri, (2) Blackmores cube roll, (3) flat iron with bone marrow  Really liked the desserts and somehow the sweet dishes were one of my favourite parts of the meal. Would really recommend folks to try the ‚Äúsnickers‚Äù and ‚Äúroast pineapple with rum sabayon‚Äù dessert items.  All in all, this place is definitely worth a visit.

113,113,5,2024-02-16,"My experience at Burnt Ends was nothing short of extraordinary. Initially, attempting to secure a reservation more than a month before our trip proved challenging, as they were fully booked. However, a stroke of luck came our way when a fellow foodie from one of my groups suggested trying a walk-in. Intrigued, we decided to forgo a hosted dinner and give it a shot. To our surprise, we arrived at 6:15 pm, and within 30 minutes, we were comfortably seated at a table - the staff informed us we had until 8:15 pm. It felt like we had won a small lottery, and the anticipation for the evening grew.  The atmosphere was everything we hoped for - chill, relaxed, and with a front-row seat to the culinary action. We enjoyed watching the chefs expertly grill our dishes, adding to the overall dining experience. The two-hour time frame was more than enough for us, and the feeling of exclusivity made the evening even more special. ü•∞  As for the food, it was a symphony of flavors. From the perfectly cooked steak to the delightful cocktails, every dish was a masterpiece. The ambiance, coupled with the superb culinary skills on display, created a dining experience that was truly sublime.

I want to preface this review by saying that I have a dietary restriction (no raw) which they graciously accommodated. So I didn't have all the caviar dishes that many would love.  Some of my faves - grissini and taramasalata dish was absolutely bomb. The leeks, hazelnut, and white truffle dish has a lovely clean flavour. The mushroom with porridge was so simple yet crazy good. The king crab and garlic brown butter is also a win. And that pie at the end is a beautiful ending.  Some misses - the grilled chicken tasted basic and a number of the replacement dishes (for non raw) is a little uninspired. Understand that I also limited them by having the food restriction but maybe expected a bit more from them as well, I've seen others cater to this and do better.  Service is good as expected from a Michelin ‚≠ê restaurant. Every dish was well-explained and we were well attended to.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

153,153,5,2023-12-18,"Burnt Ends was incredible food and great value for a 1-michelin top 100 in the world.  We had the Burnt Ends classic tasting menu, all small bites. The highlights for me were the tiramosolata and the beef jam dishes, for my wife it was the smoked quails egg with caviar, or the Jamaican chicken.  There is a cocktail on the signature menu that might just be the best cocktail I've ever tried, and it's the massiman curry cocktail, it was outstanding. The only dish I wasn't a fan of (neither was my wife) was the pulled pork Sammie. It has the texture of tuna salad sandwich, very chopped and creamy and it was hard to disassociate it with thatz as there was no texture or bite other than creamy.  Service is a bit sloppy, the pace they move at is almost frantic and not that smooth. When they are turning tables, the moment the guests depart it's a crisis mad dash to flip it and it's kind of uncomfortable for the guests around as it's just chaos watching it. You don't need to move like that to get it flipped....we are talking the difference of about 10 seconds to just smooth yourself out.

186,186,4,2023-11-18,"I didn't get Burnt Ends until I ate there.. The recurring theme of smoke and fire was instilled in almost all their dish and that matched their name perfectly.  Reserving seats at this restaurant felt like winning a mini lottery. That was how popular this place could be.  During our visit, the exterior was deceptively quiet with no receptionist and guests outdoors. Once you walked past the huge door, you'll be greeted by the grill aroma and high ceiling interiors. I would recommend getting counter seat as you can be entertained by their staff working like a clockwork during meal service.  Waitperson was on the ball and guided us through the menu. Quite a number of items were off menu which made it harder to decide.  The highlights for us were the pulled pork burger, king crab, roasted maitake with porridge. The pulled pork were finely shredded and gave a good texture with the bun. King crab was fresh and went really well with it's buttery gravy but one needs to earn this meal by patiently deshelling the crab. The smokiness of the roasted maitake paired really well with the porridge and egg yolk. However, chicken and peri peri was a letdown because it was too salty for us. Last but not least, we ended our meal with their signature roasted marshmallows. It was my first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the fillings within.  Definitely give this place a shot and good luck with your reservations!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

The food really made use of amazing fresh ingredients that are cooked to perfection. The beef steak at the end had a nice char to the crust. The uni on the crab toast was mouth wateringly good. The marmalade beef on toast was also so soft and delicious.  Overall, a superb dinner. The cocktails and wine selection were also amazing, and I highly recommend ordering.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

205,205,4,2023-10-19,"This place takes steak house food to the level of fine dining. Very innovative small dishes really showed off chefs skill.  The price is on the high side, and chefs menu isn't a fixed price menu like other omakase type of places.  They don't sell coffee, so don't expect to have a cappuccino to go with dessert.  Update: reduce 1 star. I ordered one glass of wine, and it was obvious the wine was not newly opened. The waitor said it's from yesterday. $36 for an overnight wine is way below the standard of their dishes and I hope they will address this practice.  Update Nov 22: reduce 1 star due to the ridiculous reservation system. Seems that this place deliberately makes the reservation process difficult. Perhaps as a marketing tool to attract the FOMOs? More popular places are easier to book.  Update Sept 23. Visited their new location at Dempsey Hill, oh boy what an upgrade of venue. The new place is way bigger and the decor is totally Instagram worthy. The wine price seems to have come down, so add 1 star back to my rating.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

It was like dinner and a show. We went with the chefs choice and the food just kept coming. After 2 hours they had to roll us out. I can't wait to visit again in the future. An fyi on snagging a reservation, they book 60 days out and open reservations at 10am Singapore time so do the math on the day you want and at 10am refresh your browser and book, worked for me.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
208,208,1,2023-10-19,"If I could give a zero star I would. It started with the chefs menu when my wife said she didn‚Äôt like sea urchin, we laughed with the waiter as this was a smokehouse - and the first course was, well, you guessed it.  The wine was massively overpriced, unfortunately as Brits we didn‚Äôt complain - should have asked for the house wine as that‚Äôs supposed to be the showcase.  The food was ok, but for a SGD1200 bill it should have been amazing. It wasn‚Äôt. There are many more amazing restaurants in Singapore that will charge half the price for a better meal.  If you want meat, go to Meatsmith. If you want a quality high end meal, go to the Tippling Club. Or choose any other option",Burnt Ends Restaurant

From the moment I walked in, the ambiance struck a chord‚Äîa perfect blend of casual sophistication that put me at ease immediately. But the true showstopper of the evening had to be the Steak Frites. Cooked to perfection and bursting with flavors that tantalized my taste buds, I was simply mind-blown.  As for the cocktails, they were in a league of their own. Each drink was a unique concoction that managed to surprise and delight in equal measure. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of classic mixes or eager to try something adventurous, the cocktail menu will not disappoint.

One of my BFFs managed to get a table, and so we came! This location is more inaccessible than its previous, but quite suitable for Burnt Ends class of restaurant (read: having a car).  As opposed to burnt (as its name suggests), the menu we got for the night is a fine balance between caramelised and carbonised. They might appear burnt, especially the marshmallows, but take a bite and its soft white fluffy gooey sweetness oozes.  The only downside, I‚Äôd say, is its bite-sized portions. Lucky for us, we ordered a wide spread to fill us all up!

The menu isn‚Äôt fixed but there were a few items we were told that we had to order.  Grissini and taramasalata - a very simple looking dish but this packed a serious flavour bomb. Might have been our favourite dish here tbh.  Vindaloo Pork Belly - This was one of the more disappointing dish. The flavour was really flat, no Smokey flavour and just didn‚Äôt taste marinated. Yes the lime did help elevate the taste but still was average.  Other dishes we ordered:  Sourdough bread - with a bakery next door, we knew the bread would be good. The butter and olive oil that came with were excellent as well.  Eggplant with miso - the batter used in the eggplant reminded me or the ‚Äúgoreng pisang‚Äù (fried bananas) batter which I didn‚Äôt quite enjoy. The miso sauce was good with the hit of chilli.  Crab and pork stickers - I‚Äôm a big dumplings person so this was the most disappointing dish here. Honestly even a hawker centre dumplings would be better.  Chicken and Peri Peri - well cooked and seasoned dish. For the price you pay though, I would have definitely expected more. Maybe a vegetable or starch side. But this dish did pack a lot of flavour.  Steak - Definitely had better.  Overall, the service was great with really attentive staff. The food wasn‚Äôt bad, but just didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations.

Let me say that the venue is absolutely beautiful ‚Äî what a difference from its previous location at Teck Lim. With its atmospheric broody lighting, the private room is definitely a sight to see with its installation piece atop the dining table and cascading cryptic shadows. You have your own wait staff and definitely a lot of privacy ‚Äî if its worth the absolute ridiculous amount that you are willing to pay for it.  The whole experience of the 12 courses spans from the famous smoked quail caviar tarte to (which I think is controversial) its chicken rice, the best hits of their popular menus. The menu is unctuous, its performative (turbot cooked in front of you? Why not), it is just the right amount of ups and downs and travels through your palettes well. Topped it all of with a full baba au rhum that we definitely could not finish.  Would I suggest this experience, if you‚Äôre willing to shelve deep into your pockets, I would say yes.

We used to live in Singapore and have since moved away. This trip is short city holiday for us. I was a fan of their Teck Lim venue and have been there a few times. Whilst the description on the cocktail bar section states that it serves only bar food and classics menu, really did not expect the type of food served. Very basic pub food dressed up as fine dining. Extremely disappointing. Nothing was good. Wine list was more suited to fine dining restaurant than a wine/cocktail bar. Make up your mind - is this a cocktail bar or a fine dining restaurant. Can't be both. Very very disappointed. Pains me to say this as I had fond memories - will not be back ever. As a final comment, I must say though, the wait staff were all excellent - can't fault the service.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
275,275,5,2023-07-21,"What an amazing restaurant! A complete package. Mind boggling cocktails (special mention to Louise at the bar, who made us cocktails exactly what we asked for), also really liked 'keep your gingers crossed'. So much flavour in all the dishes, our highlight was Jamaican chuck and Grissini with taramasalata. The dishes had literal burnt ends, and so much of charriness and caramelized good bitz! Must try when you are in Singapore.  We want burnt end restaurants at all the major Australian cities @Dave Pynt.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Tips for booking: sign up multiple waiting list and you might get one if someone cancels last minutes. It‚Äôs wonderful experience. Every dish is amazing. Got a chance to chat with the chef too (sitting at the bar table). One of the best bbq place we have ever been. Will definitely want to revisit.,Burnt Ends Restaurant

It‚Äôs a good experience to try once, but I will not return.  The management can do better to cool the restaurant because I was sweating!!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

302,302,5,2023-07-21,"Among the hardest to get reservations in town, but well worth the effort!  I loved the casual yet refined atmosphere¬†and food! We ordered a la carte, basically everything that sounded good to us and with some help¬†of the super friendly¬†waiter. Beef and uni is a classic and yes it is as good as it sounds. Some vegetable dishes and nibbles led us to the main, a flat iron steak with bone marrow and burnt onions. This was a straight¬†üíØ  Overall I really enjoyed the inherent smokey flavours all dishes incorporated in their taste profile. We ordered some white and red wine by the glass and the sommelier¬†made great recommendations.  As a traveller to Singapore I had very little¬†time to pin down a reservation and indeed I could not get one using the online reservation tool. This was my third visit to Singapore without making it to Burnt Ends, so I decided to just try a walk in. I arrived at 11.30 and waited for them to open. Once opened I was told they are fully booked, but they can give me a table for 2pm. Awesome üôå",Burnt Ends Restaurant

We feasted on the King Crab and Garlic brown Butter (Yeah! very healthy :) .. kidding) this was amazing and definitely worth the visit. the service was fantastic and the staff was very friendly and I find very knowledgeable too. as they were very helpful for all my question about the dishes. We tried the White Asparagus (again delicious) and the Team was kind to offer us Egg Plant and Miso on the House.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by a great relaxing atmosphere that instantly put me at ease. The interior design and lighting created a cozy ambiance, making it the perfect place to enjoy a leisurely meal.  One of the first things that caught my attention was the ample parking available during lunchtime. It's always a relief to find convenient parking, especially when you're eager to satisfy your appetite without any hassle. This restaurant truly takes care of its customers by providing this convenience.  The service at this eatery was exemplary, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure a pleasant dining experience. The servers were friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were prompt in attending to our needs, offering recommendations and answering any questions we had. Their warm and attentive demeanor added to the overall positive experience.  Now, let's talk about the star of the show‚Äîthe food. Each dish that arrived at our table was served nice and warm, demonstrating the attention to detail in the kitchen. I had the pleasure of trying the pulled pork burger, which was an absolute delight. The flavors were well-balanced, and the meat was tender and juicy. It was clear that the chef had put thought into every component of the dish. In fact, all the dishes we ordered were equally impressive, showcasing the culinary expertise of the kitchen.  Of course, I cannot fail to mention the excellent tenderloin. It was cooked to perfection, tender and succulent, leaving me craving for more. The quality of the ingredients was evident, and the dish was executed flawlessly. It truly was a standout item on the menu, and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting this establishment.  Overall, my lunch experience at this restaurant was nothing short of wonderful. The great relaxing atmosphere, ample parking, friendly and prompt service, and outstanding food made for a memorable dining occasion.

314,314,5,2023-07-21,"Our first experience did not disappoint and I can sincerely recommend Burnt Ends for those who enjoy premium, high quality ingredients, unique combinations, rich umami flavours and warm, flawless service.  If you have a good appetite and want to explore the offerings without having to decide what to order, the Chef‚Äôs Set is a good ‚ÄúOmakase‚Äù option, where Chef chooses what dishes to serve up based on your general likes and preferences. Definitely a pricier option (probably possible to inform the restaurant to work within your upper limit, if required) but it offers an exciting experience to not know what will be brought to your table, and the food just keeps coming non-stop! Some of our favourite dishes were off-menu items for that particular day (such as the uni toast, maitaki mushroom rice, eel toast). We didn‚Äôt love everything we tried, as some were mediocre or forgettable in comparison - but still enjoyed the variety.  Some additional thoughts: 1. Burnt Ends serves super rich, umami dishes - think bone marrow, butter, marbled steak, Uni, lobster - and because we had the set (and probably ate way too much food) it would have been nice to have some palette cleansers, tangy sauces or citrus salads etc to cut the fat / richness. Probably not an issue if you‚Äôre just ordering few ala carte items.  2.  If you get to choose, counter seats are better for groups of 2 cuz you get to watch the action in the kitchen.  3. Jasmine was a great host - fun personality, quick to address questions, knowledgeable about the menu and just provided overall fantastic service. The whole team here work hard and are true professionals.  Will revisit (if I can secure a seat!!!!) in the future for sure!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

644,644,3,2024-06-15,Opted for their Omakase dinner ard $470 per pax. The environment is nice and vibrant. Great attention in service but the food didn‚Äôt impress. The one I think most appealing to my palate is the lobster. Cooked just nice the texture is right. The worst thing that is happening is was so hot we asked them if they could adjust temperature yet they said nothing could be done. Can you imagine perspiring through the dinner which served 10 courses? And we are actually sitting in the middle table not at the bar.,Burnt Ends Restaurant

657,657,2,2024-06-15,"Let me start by saying that if this review was based off of service alone, it would be 5 stars as the staff all tried to make the best of the circumstances.  My wife and I had saved up for a few months to come to Singapore (among other places) for our honeymoon and we planned on our dinner at Burnt Ends being the celebratory dining experience of the trip to cap it off at the very end. As others have mentioned, it was difficult to get a reservation. A few days ahead of our booking, we received an email asking us to change our reservation to a later time and from the study to the cocktail bar. We didn't want to lose the date entirely as we only had a few days left so we agreed, especially since it wasn't a huge change.  When we arrived for our booking, our table wasn't ready and we were asked if we could start off seated at a table to the back / side and we would shortly be moved to the cocktail bar. Sure, why not. After being seated, we realized that this table was the closest, or at least very close, to the bathrooms. Then, to our surprise, food started being brought out to our table very quickly (we were on a set menu, given it was at the cocktail bar where this menu is fixed). Not wanting to make a bad situation worse, we let it be, though we did raise our concern. Ultimately, we weren't invited to move to our originally booked seats at the bar until most of our set meal had been finished (the items were mostly bite sized and brought out in quick succession).  As I mentioned, the staff seemed to be quite sympathetic, which we appreciated. But the whole experience still fell far short of what I had hoped for, when I was half way around the world planning this dinner with my new wife.  I should also say that some of the food items were good (berry pie), but most just tasted very salty and simple to both of us. That said, I suppose taste is subjective.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

My experience of Burnt Ends is up there with the most underwhelming and over rated.  We were seated at the kitchen bench, which is great if you don't want to chat to the others in your group, but the kitchen bench is really designed for couples.  Wonderful to watch the chefs at work - I loved the precision and skills.  Our group of 3 shared everything and we had: * Grilled Crab & Pork Sticker (tiny, tiny portion, not worth the money) - 15SGD per person * Jamaican chicken and lime crema - nice - 6SGD per person * Karubi Ssamjang - wow, wow, wow - the best dish of the night (beef) and good value - 20SGD - and a portion enough for 3 to share * Roasted chicken - okay - 70SGD * Beef tenderloin 285g, burnt onion and bone marrow - delicious and I'd recommend as the best value and taste of the beef cuts - 114SGD * Japanese A5 Kagoshima Striploin 210g - quite tasteless (and definitely not as good as the tenderloin) - 221SGD  Desserts were expensive for the portion size.  As with all alcohol in Singapore, expensive.  No wines less than 200SGD.  Sadly, the most underwhelming meal I've had in probably 20 years - and dropping 340SGD per person is just outrageous.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

717,717,4,2024-06-15,"I‚Äôll get the 2 negative experiences with regards to the service out of the way and then highlight the great food and drinks.  Firstly, it‚Äôs quite disappointing to have food placed on your table and the server hurriedly walking away without even telling you what dish it is, much less describing it. When we tried to get his attention as he was placing down the 2nd dish, once again without a word, he just walked away with his tray to serve another table. We did manage to get another staff to attend to us after a while. Secondly, we were seated 20mins pass our reservation even though we arrived on time. When we were seated the staff told us they need the table back in an hour and a half. And then again just as we got our first round of drinks, another staff came over and reminded us the same thing. We know they have 2 or 3 seatings for the evening but we didn‚Äôt appreciate being hurried thru dinner because they didn‚Äôt clear the first sitting on time. Rest of the evening went well and most of the other staff were great, but these 2 staff have no place in a Michelin starred restaurant.  They have a very extensive cocktails menu and all 7-8 cocktails we ordered were very good. One of the staff came by and helped us with our drinks order and he did a pretty good job matching our preference to items on the drinks list. Probably one of the best location for cocktails anywhere in Singapore. Food was also very well prepared. We ordered the classic tasting menu for our group and it was a good selection of items. Anything with beef on it is always great. Would try and come back to try the other items on the menu.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

725,725,3,2024-06-15,"We struggled to reconcile our experience, expectations, and the hype for Burnt Ends. With no luck at the main dining area after ages, we settled to check out the bar section of Burnt Ends.  One thing that really irked us was once we were sat down, we were told we need to leave by 9pm. I totally understand restaurants having two seatings to maximise profits, but perhaps there‚Äôs a more tactful way to handle this? It felt very unwelcome to be told when we need to leave the second we sat down.  Liked the deco, ambience is nice overall but the music is so incredibly loud we couldn‚Äôt have a decent conversation, nor could we hear what the attendants were saying when they served the food. Cocktails were nice though. We would‚Äôve loved to stay for more drinks if the loud music wasn‚Äôt giving us a headache.  We were seated at what they called the ‚Äúlounge‚Äù area. So the table is low, and that made it difficult to have a pleasant eating experience. Would recommend to choose the bar counter or high table if available.  As for the food, we opted for the Burnt End Classic menu which has a bit of everything. I‚Äôd say some dishes were hit-and-miss and the best one out of the classic menu was the pulled pork slider and my personal favourite, the marshmallow for dessert.  Not sure if we‚Äôll be rushing back anytime soon. Maybe we will try the main dining if we get a chance, otherwise I‚Äôd say there are other places in Singapore that offer better value for money in terms of service, food, ambience.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

It can just be a happy birthday greetings from your staff. But well, nobody cares‚Ä¶ The food is great, steak is nice.. but would I visit again to eat that steak? We have to wait for almost an hour before the steak is served. Yes, I understand good food needs to wait.. but the waiting time is a bit too long.. I visited Sexy Cow in Bangkok, they didn‚Äôt take that long to serve the same quality and impressive steak‚Ä¶ Price is also a bit too high.. yes, maybe this is for the famous and rich.. but certainly not for me.. one piece of quail egg caviar for $18? Fennel, orange and burrata for $26? Really? Items like Cubans Pork Belly is $20, this is quite value for money on the contrary. Also we requested for plain water and to my shock it‚Äôs $6 per cup.. we would have requested for just one serving of plain water if we know the price.. The staff service if you asked me, is just normal and not memorable. However, One staff stands out is the one who serves us the cocktail. He bother to ask what I would like in a cocktail and then specially did a Bespoke 30 for me.. which to me is the best item for that lunch. What I can suggest to the staff in general is they could be more helpful in suggesting the lunch menu.. we actually wanted to try the burger.. but it‚Äôs not listed on the lunch menu.. the staff suggested us to go for Chef‚Äôs pick.. which is $270 to $350 per person.. this is beyond my budget.

749,749,2,2024-06-15,"Tried the Bar Classic Menu. Food portions were really miniscule, one mouthful type of portions generally (9 dishes I reckon in total). Jamaican chicken was rather bland and tasteless, worst dish of the night. Essentially 1 mid wing shared between 2 people. Pork Sanger burger didnt taste any different from usual pulled pork, perhaps my less cultured tastebuds fail me. At least the portion was fair and they didnt make 2 of us share half a burger each. Standout dishes were the Beef marmalade, Grissini, Steak Frites. We were given a single slice of their berry tart to share between 2 people! Talk about being stingy with the portions... No complimentary drink/dessert for my wife's birthday but I understand no restaurant is obliged to do so for their customers.  All in all an underwhelming and disappointing experience for a fine dining establishment. Finished off my night with a packet of maggi noodles at home to stave off the hunger.  Saving grace was the excellent and friendly service by the manager and waiting staff as well as the exquisitely designed interior (we were seated in the bar section, Study).  Unfortunate to say but we wont be back, particularly not at this exorbitant price point ($250 pre GST/service tax for 2pax).

We were seated in the Cocktail bar but were allowed to order from the restaurant menu, which was a great surprise. The staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  We had the duck liver parfait tartlet, lamb cigar, and vindaloo pork taco to start. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. The duck liver parfait tartlet was a standout dish with its creamy texture and delicate taste. The lamb cigar was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, while the vindaloo pork taco had just the right amount of spice.  Next, we had the buttermilk fried drumlets and Grissini with taramasalata. The drumlets were crispy and juicy, and the Grissini with taramasalata was a lovely, light dish perfect for sharing. We had their ""steak frites"", an excellent interpretation of a great dish. We also had terrific grilled duck hearts, Matsusaka wagyu cooked to perfection.  Not to be ignored, the cocktails are phenomenal and a must-try. You'll be in excellent hands with Louis who will certainly recommend the perfect cocktail to suit your tastes.  Overall, the dining experience at Burn Ends was fantastic. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was welcoming and cozy. I recommend Burn Ends to anyone looking for great food in Singapore.""",Burnt Ends Restaurant

806,806,1,2024-06-15,"If I had to describe my experience at Burnt Ends with one word, it would be ""salty"".  I was looking forward to trying Burnt Ends for a long time. Finally managed to get a booking but it was for the bar which I didn't mind since I would still get to try a fair few of Burnt Ends dishes. Ended up ordering the tasting menu because I wanted to try a variety of dishes.  The first dish was the Quail egg which was... Alright. Wasn't quite the explosion of flavours I was expecting but it was okay. Then it started going downhill from there. Every dish after was heavily laden with salt. It's not that I have a sensitivity to salt or rich food. In fact I'm more likely to oversalt my food at times. But at Burnt Ends, the food was incredibly salty. Some dishes had good flavours but they were all completely overwhelmed with salt. The only reason I finished most of my food was because it really wasn't cheap at $250 for two people. I am highly disappointed by my experience.  I like to think that they achieved a ranking in the World's Top 50 Restaurant with a less salty menu. I cannot imagine anyone enjoying the meal I had here.  The manager at the bar, Louise, was amazing. His service was top notch. He tried to do some service recovery by offering us an additional dish when we told him the food was too salty. I enjoyed the cocktail and the ambience of the bar was good.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
807,807,1,2024-06-15,"Worst food I had in a restaurant ever. Erm. Really. I had the tasting menu and hated the extremely salty food. Only forced myself to finish some of the dishes because it was so expensive.  Quail egg - was alright Grissini and taramasalata - salty but alright still, chives gave it a slight zing Steak frites - extremely salty and over seasoned Jamaican chicken - extremely salty and over seasoned Beef marmalade - extremely salty and over seasoned; at this stage I felt my body bloat from the water retention Leek - extremely salty and I didn't like the taste. Did not finish. Burnt Ends Sanger - extremely salty and forced myself to finish it; I thought my watch strap become extremely tight from the possible bloating Berry tart - yay dessert should be sweet? But nope. It was too salty. Marshmallows - also salty.. This time, salty and bitter.  Louis/Lewis, the manager, was really nice.

813,813,1,2024-06-15,"Hello Burnt Ends,  I am writing to inform you about my unpleasant dinner experience on 2 March at 8pm.  I have planned this dinner for my partner and myself for quite awhile and selected Burnt Ends as the restaurant is known to be one of the world‚Äôs 50 best restaurants and has held a One-Michelin star.  This naturally means your customers are coming to your restaurant with fairly high and reasonable expectations.  1)Menu As the dinner is planned, I have previously requested the menu over email on 15th February and I was agreeable to the menu before I made a reservation for 2 March.  When I arrived for the actual dinner on 2 March, I was caught by surprise as the menu is different from the one I received.  I think the minimum service expected from a One-Michelin star restaurant would be for your team to at least me of this menu change before my actual dinner so that we would not be caught off guard on the actual dinner day. In the event there was any dishes or ingredients that me or my partner could not take, I would then have ample time to make alternative plans.  2) Food Preferences  As I did not want to start our dining experience negatively, I chose to continue with the latest menu and went ahead with our orders. During our ordering, we specifically mentioned to the staff that we do not take beef.  One of the dishes served was a ‚Äòmarshmallow‚Äô dish and turns out that it contains beef. When we questioned the staff about this, the staff responded that they thought we do not take pork. Due to this mistake, the staff mentioned they will replaced the marshmallow dish with ice cream. A few moments later, another staff whom does not seem to know what has just happened, served us the same marshmellow dish!  The above screw up is the second mistake of the night and really starting to ruin our whole evening!  3)Missing Dish and Portioning  Half way through the dinner, one of the dishes did not arrive and I had to highlight this to the staff. The staff then realise it is true they missed it out and served it quickly. The entire dining experience was really falling apart at this point and we are really close to just walking out.  During the 4th course, the manager (Louise) asked if everything was ok. We commented that the dish portions were quite small and he replied that we can let him know again after we have tried the burger. This respond is simply unprofessional because we did not come to a One Michelin Star restaurant to be stuffed by burgers.  ‚Äî  I am a tourist from Taiwan and I researched and look forward so much to visit Burnt Ends based on the information about you I could find online, trusting that a One-Michelin Star place definitely has top notch service and would serve every customer with pride. We are here for the overall dining experience which includes the service, the curation of the menu, the freshness of the dishes and carefully sourced ingredients, the ambience all of which is what Burnt Ends is known for however based on my mentioned pointers above, I believe you can understand how disappointed of a customer I am.  I truly hope that this message is well received by Burnt Ends and that you would take time to really evaluate and improve your customer experience.  Thank you",Burnt Ends Restaurant

822,822,3,2024-06-15,"Came for  dinner (March 2 at 8 pm )with my partner which I have planned for a while to surprise him . But the service was below average and the burgers were too salty to be rated as a signature one. We had expected more than that based on restaurant reputation.  When we arrived at restaurant , checked the menu which was different from the one I received from you on 15th of feb. If you‚Äôve already had the menu for March , we should‚Äôve received the upcoming one as we made reservation for March. If so we wouldn‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt get surprised by the price difference.  And when we took orders that we have mentioned that we don‚Äôt take beef but instead staff thought we don‚Äôt take ‚Äúpork‚Äù and replaced the marshmallow dish with ice cream.  Staff served us marshmallow dish again after we reminded him once more.  There‚Äôs also one dish in between not been served at first place and served again after our reminder.  When the manager ( Louise if I remember it correctly) asked if everything was ok, we said the dish portion was way too small compared with our dinning experience we had at similar restaurants and he just replied after you had the burger and let me know again if the food is enough which we found  it was not appropriate to say so. We didn‚Äôt pay the price to be stuffed by the burgers and they were really salty compared to the pulled pork burgers we had before .  I was really excited about visiting( all the way from Taiwan) burnt ends with my partner to surprise him, but the rest of the above experience was not pleasant",Burnt Ends Restaurant

I‚Äôm shocked they managed to get our entire order correct.  For such an expensive, luxury dining experience, I expect every seat to be a pleasant dining experience. However, we were seated at the end of the chefs counter, where the bartender makes drinks. Our entire view was blocked by bottles, and it was right next to the back of house service kitchen door. It was hard to have a conversation and enjoy the ambiance because I felt like I was part of the service team with how much foot traffic was happening next to us.  Pros: food is awesome. Surprisingly, my favorite was the quail egg. Their chicken wings are also mind blowing. They had an very tasty umeshu cocktail.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

The most unique dish I tasted was the fennel and burrata dish. The peri peri chicken was very tender but too salty for my taste.

In a box of customized donuts, you get to choose from a palatable selection: Vanilla Cream, Nutella, Pandan, Iranian Pistachio, lemon meringue, milo dinosaur, Japanese yuzu, and Passion fruit curd.

934,934,4,2024-06-15,"I was pleasantly surprised that we were able to get a reservation at short notice for a visitor. It turned out we nabbed a table at the cocktail bar section with a limited menu, rather than the main restaurant, but it's still a great way to try the Burnt Ends experience. The ambience of the cocktail bar is quite something and the cocktails are a treat. Hardly Dave in Sun was our favourite.  Do note that the cocktail bar does not offer the full dinner menu. You can get a set of 8 of Burnt Ends' classic offerings in taster portions for 2 people at $200, or pick from a small menu of bar snacks. This was still fine for us as the taster portions provide a neat introduction to their best-known dishes, and add up to be filling in the end (though we were sorry each time we finished one of the options too quickly... You may find yourself looking longingly at the main restaurant).  What I'd really like to commend Burnt Ends on is how helpful and lovely the staff were. We had a vegetarian in our party and the staff made thoughtful recommendations, even from the limited menu, so she still had good things to eat. When we got too cold in the cocktail area, they let us switch to an outdoor table. And they were kind and flexible in allowing us to order a three-person version of the two-person set. Thank you very much for making our evening!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

965,965,3,2024-06-15,"We went here for in Dec 2022. When we first arrived, it was nice and chilly outside and we were advised to wait for a short while as the previous groups had not finished. It was a pleasant outdoor wait and we were shortly escorted inside at the chef‚Äôs table.  The vibe was really quite fantastic as you are all the chefs moving to and fro, just like a culinary dance. It was nice watching them. They say even the act of watching food being prepared for consumption is part of digestion.  We were welcomed and shown how the menu was separated (small plates, Med plates, mains, dessert). Then we were told the specials on the side. Tbh, I would have expected that specials are written down on a separate sheet as not everyone has that great a memory. If it was written down, there would be a higher chance of ordering the specials.  It was also a good thing we remembered the mushroom special should be ordered, otherwise we would have missed out a really good thing.  The flat iron and the steak with toast and mustard is good too. Grissilini was good too.  But overall, I felt the food wasn‚Äôt as much on point as I expected. I spoke to some friends who also ate at burnt ends before and they too had the same review.  Other comments on service. Being at the counter seat, I would have expected more interaction between the chef and the customers, more spontaneous action and engagement to take the dining experience up a notch. However, all that remains is an invisible curtain between the kitchen action and the customers.  Further, the staff, although they paid attention while taking orders and explaining the dish, most times we heard them talking not so quietly to one another at the sides while waiting for service etc. when we tried to get their attention, many of them didn‚Äôt see to have their focus on the customers but on their fellow colleagues instead.  We also found that the staff seem to be in a great rush. One step away from light jogging, which to me is very wrong in a restaurant. One should be busy, but never rush, especially not in a high energy environment amongst sharps as that‚Äôs when accidents are most likely to happen. In all that flurry of activity, the beauty of each dish, each moment, is watered down to just being food.  Staff are very much in need of cultivating steadfastness, calmness and the mastery of control over a place.  Lastly, service related uniforms should be washed daily. More than 1 staff that walked by or came to serve dishes carried with them a certain homely smell, or the smell of unwashed clothes. This affects the dining experience and this detail should be looked into.  In summary, Food: 3.5/5 Ambience: 3.5/5 Staff: 3/5 Hence I struggle to give more than 3 stars for this experience. It had a lot of potential though!",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Soft serve donut was quite a mess to eat and did not really stand out for me.  Service was friendly, but would suggest for the 'pastries of the day' and 'seasonal flavour' items to be labelled as well so that customers need not ask what are they. Prob would speed up the queue.

971,971,2,2024-06-15,"Definately a one and done restaurant. Doesn't match the hype and an exercise in expectation management. Doesn't stand up to its 1 star status. Small portions, expensive, good wait staff, poor/unacceptable wait process.  Backgroud So we've been trying to get a table at burnt ends for a few years everytime we visit singapore. Even before it moved. No luck as it was always fully booked. This time we were online everyday at 10am when they opened reservations 1 month ahead, frantically clicking. Finally got a table for 2 at lunch after a week of trying. Needless to say, expectations are high (even though reviews from friends who had been were pretty mixed)  The good Food - tasty. Good but not great. Still not sure why a 200g steak takes 45m to cook though. Even with resting time. I'm guessing there's a long queue of orders for steak Wait staff - very polite, quick and knowledgeable about the dishes  The bad Wait process - this was the worst. totally ok for a normal restaurant but unacceptable for a 1 star. Front door greeted and led us in. Didn't hold the door, just opened it and walked in (It's a small thing). Got seated and given a drinks menu and then left at the table. No waiter came with the food menu or follow up. We just sat there waiting for someone to come but nada. Eventually had to get a waiter to come and asked for a menu. Also no recommendations or guide on the food until we asked. Again, for a 1 star, this should be proactive. Not reactive Portions - for everything apart from the steaks, assume finger food portions. This should have been explained better by wait staff. Eg. Tartar on potatoes and beef cigar. When explained what they were, we assumed bigger portions. Turns out they were bite sized Price and sizing - 400 dollar lunch (Inc 1 cocktail and 2 beers). Basically needed another meal after.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Will come back for the Uni and Wagyu dish, crab, leek, and of course the desserts!

First of all, Jasmine, who is the waitress of our table was great at making suggestions as it was our first time at the place. When we chose to go ahead with Chef‚Äôs Select, she took down all the varying dietary restrictions before ensuring the table gets an enjoyable dining experience. Throughout, she was very attentive and also made plenty of conversations with different individuals to ensure all things are going well and to further develop the enjoyable experience.  There was nothing but praise for the food at Burnt Ends. The Chef‚Äôs Select courses were extensive and had great variety for the group to taste what Burnt Ends has to offer on its menu.  My personal favourites were: 1) Beef and Uni - a mix of beef and seafood that has no one side overpowering the other in your mouth 2) Leek, hazelnut and truffle - the leek was sweet and soft, where the hazelnut added an additional texture in the mouth 3) Blackmores‚Äô striploin - medium rare done, melt in your mouth steak along with the tastiest side of rocket salad 4) King crab with garlic brown butter - sweetness of the crab can be tasted, further enhanced by the slight savoury taste from the butter  Special call out to the sourdough that we ordered. I loved how dense the bread was which was perfect in soaking up the garlic brown butter which added an additional dimension to the sourdough.  The entire course was filled with laughter, friendly staff team on duty that day and delicious yet unforgettable food.  Definitely would want to visit again and have other friends to experience what I did.  Great job Burnt Ends team, and especially Jasmine.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

1019,1019,2,2024-06-15,"*Warning* Unpopular Opinion Incoming:  I don't get it. I really really don't. I am extremely disappointed by this restaurant. The amount of effort into getting a reservation, the reputation surrounding it, and even some of these google reviews had my wife and I so excited to dine here for our 4th wedding anniversary, I am still in shock by how poor an experience we had.  Not one time during our time here did 1 single staff member wish us a happy anniversary, or thank us for choosing them to celebrate with, as with most eateries on this side of the world, we had to flag down a server nearly every step of the way. Our waiter also was quite pushy on items we ""must order"" to the point he wasn't really even listening to what I was trying to order, he would point to another item while I was in mid sentence and exclaim ""Oh no, you must order this, very good this one"". I appreciate suggestions and recommendations, but man, let me finish speaking before you barrage me with ""must orders"".  Everything in this restaurant is brown, or a shade of brown, or in the color wheel of brown. Seriously there is not one pop of color anywhere to be found, no pictures, paintings, art, fish tank, etc. It was like being in house made of chocolate or something, there was nothing interesting to visually see other than the open kitchen where 10+ people seem to be needed for a half full restaurant. (Our reservation was 6:30 - 3/4 the tables were empty but started to fill up later towards 8PM).  OK - On to the food, which was the biggest part of our frustration. I have been to several ""fine dining"" establishments before, I get the idea. Small portions, quality food, unique concepts is the norm, however here it seems to just be small portions. We ordered at least 7- 8 dishes, including the Grissini, Sanger, eggplant, eel, garlic shoots, Bone marrow bun, and striploin, so we got a fair sample of the entire menu, including some of the highly recommended dishes I see in these reviews. Nearly every dish mentioned, comes with some sort of Aioli heavy sauce, over the top amounts of oil, and enough salt to cause even an Olympian to start having heart palpitations. No joke I could feel my blood pressure rising 3/4 through this meal. There was absolutely zero balance to these dishes, nothing helped bring down the oil taste/feeling of these items, no acid, no bite, nothing. They all sort of tasted the exact same. Its like eating heavy frosting cake then downing a rich milkshake, its just too much. There was also zero texture to anything, since every item was covered in so much oil, it was all super soft and mushy, when you were hoping for a crispy bite to help with the super soft aioli/sauce/oil, you got none. Oh here comes the next dish- surprise! Drenched in oil and salt!  I feel I am a pretty fair judge when it comes to steak...being from Texas in USA, I have had many... mannnnyyy steaks in my life, the one I had last evening was just mediocre. Nothing about it was memorable at all, it had no sear, no body, nothing on the side to accentuate the texture or flavor other than a weak fennel salad, drenched in....you guessed it...oil based vinaigrette! With the massive open face fire pit in the back of the kitchen... I was really hopefully to get something with some sear or char or anything to capture that flavor of the fire, but it seems like that is just for show, the steak I had tasted/appeared like it was just oven baked to medium rare. The bone marrow bun was just more of the same, soft, mushy, salty, oily, etc. At this point in the meal it was nearly impossible to finish, so much jelak buildup and salt overload that we were pounding the waters ($12 mind you). Finally the ordeal was over, they cleared our table and had us sit for another 15 minutes before anyone came back...at this point we had tapped out, the fa√ßade had faded away, the curtain was pulled back and the illusion was revealed, we were not impressed by this smoke show. With literally thousands of other restaurants in SG, I can not in the right mind recommend this place to anyone.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

1024,1024,5,2024-06-15,"Overall happy with the food and will revisit.  As what many others had shared, it is very difficult to get a booking here.  Ambiance is quite nice with alot of wood and special lighting. Just note that it may be a little warm and I won't recommend to wear long sleeve here as its pretty warm in an aircon room context. Not the romantic place but more family or friendly type of place.  Food: Many food I ordered is nice, but the key highlights are the beef cube which stands about half of my total spending. The burger is very juicy and nice. One thing I'll ask my friends not to order is the quail egg with caviar as it cost $16 each before taxes totally not worth it. The other food is decent and nice.  Service: The people working here are very fast with no real dead end spot, so just raise your hands if you need anything. For a one star restaurant, you don't expect service is good as their focus is on the food. But I won't say service is not prompt but they could do better. Its still acceptable to me as occasionally the server will come and check if everything is alright.  Toilet - one of the restaurant with more unisex toilet and clean. So it's not a nightmare, otherwise other toilet at dempsey restaurant is really a headache.  Overall I like it and I'll give 4.7 stars, as Google don't allow decimals, I'll give this a 5 stars rating. If you find this feedback helpful, do give a thumbs up so more people can see this review.

No queue too!  Got a hot chocolate ($6.50) because, again, heavy rain and cold weather, a passionfruit doughnut ($5), a pistachio doughnut ($6), a beef marmalade focaccia ($8) and a tiramisu pastry ($12). The focaccia was absolutely delicious with the tangy sauce and pickles, and the doughnuts were fluffy, not oily (even after 8h), and had p fragrant fillings. But the hot chocolate was a little small imo and the tiramisu pastry is way overpriced haha + the pastry was underwhelming and the filling was quite jelak.  But it was a really nice experience overall and the selection is so large that I can definitely see myself coming back to try the milo doughnut and some other pastries!",Burnt Ends Restaurant
1038,1038,2,2024-06-15,"Underwhelming and Overpriced.  Saying this place is overpriced, is a huge understatement.  It‚Äôs undeniable that Singapore is expensive, but Burnt Ends takes it to a new level.  They pride themselves on Australian beef (for good reason, it‚Äôs some of the best in the world) but even with the added logistics of getting food to Singapore, the price of their food is downright ridiculous.  We had 3 different waiters (try to) explain the menu and specials and the whole experience is clumsy and not helpful. To the point where the specials sound like main meals (Fish and Chips and Steak Tartare) but in theory they are just bite size specials that range from $30-$60 per bite. Yes, per bite.  Now they were very tasty and there is no denying that but that sweet taste turns sour when you get the bill and the waiters haven‚Äôt explained how much that bite actually was.  The ‚Äòmains‚Äô are where the real price shock starts. We got a Blackmore Striploin and it was $75 per 100g. They brought the piece of meat out and it wasn‚Äôt even big enough (170g) for one person.  But to add another one you‚Äôre talking up to $250 for a main meal.  After speaking with a couple of other restaurants while in Singapore, it‚Äôs well known how much they mark up their produce.  We got our $800 bill at the end and left hungry.  If you‚Äôre looking for a good steak and a restaurant with a nice atmosphere (it‚Äôs so loud), this isn‚Äôt the place.",Burnt Ends Restaurant

Again, it‚Äôs all relative and as long as my kids like it, hey life goes on.  I‚Äôm not sure if it deserves a 3.9, but I guess the team is under pressure to perform - cos for what‚Äôs out there, you could get something similar if not better. So it‚Äôs something the team has to ponder about.  Meanwhile, my review is solely based on product. It‚Äôs above average for me, but not a must-have where my cravings are concerned.

1050,1050,5,2024-06-15,"Finally got a chance to experience Burnt Ends! And we would say that it‚Äôs really well worth the wait!  We have to say that this is probably the best dining experience we had thus far as the food was just so good! Every dish we ordered was just amazing! Not a miss at all.  My wife who has never tasted uni nor taken smoked beef, had her first with the beef and uni!  The Smoked quail eggs and caviar was a mouthful of flavors.  The eggplant and miso was just so nice, crispy on the outside and so soft and delicious inside.  We also went for the lobster, which was split into two, hence great for sharing. Another superb option as the meat was juicy and held the smoky aroma of grill.  The highlight was the Onglet with Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow, which we ordered a 200g portion (we should have gone for 300!) as the meat was perfectly prepared (just go for medium rare) and so juicy and flavorful.  Dessert was also very good, considering that I am not a dessert person. We went for the pie.  Definitely would love to return and we can‚Äôt wait to get another reservation at this wonderful place, this time to host others to experience it!

The uni toast, with the freshest tasting uni on a beautifully piece of fried bread with crab inside. 2. The ‚Äústeak frites‚Äù, being a wonderfully deep fried potato topped with steak tartare and caviar. 3. The lobster in a smoky and flavourful sauce.  While the ambience is casual the price is not. Burnt Ends is extremely expensive, but the food and experience does live up to the hype.",Burnt Ends Restaurant
1052,1052,3,2024-06-15,Burnt Ends held an event but there was no proper information on how to place orders or get a table. I have to roam around aimlessly. The place was set up very well but seems more like a private cook out party with family & friends. Chicken was salty & expensive (cost me $30 ++for this). It was presented in a very rough manner. Not value for money.,Burnt Ends Restaurant
1053,1053,4,2024-06-15,"4 stars. Service and ambiance  - superB. I loved the interior- long table facing the open kitchen. Food - 4 over 5. I find the ""pork and mustard"" too salty and ""marshmallow"" nothing special. But of course, taste is subjective. Otherwise, I loved the gastronomic experience. Aussie 75 and negroni were worth it! Left satisfied and not stuffed, as it should be, but disappointed and offended by one of the kitchen personnel.  I was trying to book this place since July but no luck. I listed myself on the waiting list but still no luck. On my last day in Singapore, I learned that Burnt ends also have a bakery, so I was like I'd give it a try. If not, then I'll get pastry and coffee!  I really really appreciate Elena for accompanying me to the host to ask if they could take me in. Thank you.  What offended me was I felt I was  being stereotyped or Filipinos (in general) by one of the kitchen personnel. As I was having ""leek, hazelnut and black truffle"", my fork slipped into the dish, the waiter behind me quickly offered to get me a new fork, but one of the kitchen personnel commented or as he said ""just kidding"", ""why don't you eat it with your hands like Filipinos do"", a colleague said ""no, she's not"" and he replied ""yea, she is but just kidding."" I am not sure what was the goal of that statement but it somehow implies that Filipinos are primitive, and is definitely a very arrogant and ignorant remark!  Overall, I was happy and thankful for the experience. It's my 13th out of 100 top restaurants in the world by #theworlds50best",Burnt Ends Restaurant
1054,1054,5,2024-06-15,"Big fan of their coffee. It‚Äôs individual taste, but my family and I like the  roasted aftertaste of coffee. We will have craving for it and will look forward to Thursdays-Sundays.  Bake items, we always love the roast beef Sandwiches, knowing that from meat to bread, it‚Äôs all made in-house. Not many bakeries/restaurants do that. It‚Äôs usually either-or that they get from suppliers and could not control quality. Sweets.. maybe because of my diet plan, I can‚Äôt eat too much donuts. Occasional bites stolen from my kids portion, do taste good. No heavy oily taste & smell, but light sugery on the dough.  Finally, we also appreciate the bakery team for their warmth whenever we walk into the shop. The happy and chirpy ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù greetings always made my day. Well done to the young and energetic group. From Manager to barista to food handlers & cashier.  The only set back is really the sitting area.

I tried the tasting menu, which had quite a few dishes (appetizers, mains, and desserts, though I ate the desserts before taking a picture) that all had a beautiful homely taste, vaguely familiar to my Indian palate. My favorite was the coconut curry. If I went again, I'd take a friend and order some full-size plates between us; I feel like I'd enjoy this restaurant more that way.

Sharing the same storefront as several other restaurants shouldve been a giveaway. Alarm bells were ringing when the decore included containers of wet wipes dotted throughout. The waitstaff had no knowledge of the wine menu and read the food menu from scripts. Many of the dishes were so poorly balanced as to be inedible.

Both were good but I thought the lychee oolang was better. It was lightly sweet with lychee and you can taste the tea in it. We chose to do the ""am-ma-kase"" tasting menu. It started with 4 small bites which are all brought out at once. This was followed by a soup course. After this, 5 main dishes were all brought out at once with rice and it is served family style. Although it's fun to sample everything, some of the dishes definitely get cold as you work your way through the dishes. My favorite of the main dishes was the ketam sayur masak lemak, which was a crab coconut curry. After dinner, you get three desserts. Overall, I enjoyed the meal since it was fun to experience a different food culture. A lot of the dishes reminded me of familiar Asian dishes and flavors but slightly different.

1118,38,5,2024-06-15,"While I have given a 5 star rating, overall and for each of the sections based on my last visit which was some time back, I also like to provide some input/feedback from a recent experience.  I wanted to book a table for lunch to celebrate my wife's birthday this week but when I learnt that there is a minimum spent of $100/person ++ ($150 for dinner), this unless I have read the notes that come up with the reservation incorrectly. I did not go ahead upon discovering this. Let me explain.  I am a Peranakan and the Peranakan people are the most critical of their cooking i.e. every other person's grandmother, mum, aunt, etc. can cook better. I think the food at Candlenut is excellent and Peranakans should break out from their shell and keep an open mind to judge the food on the quality and its taste rather than legacy reasons. So I applaud the chef/owner of Candlenut to dare and did what they have with Candlenut and Pangium (which I have tried too) i.e. elevating the dining experience with Peranakan food. Why not, people pay a lot for European and other dining experience so why not our own culture food.  That being said, I think setting a minimum spent may prevent some people, like me, from going ahead to dine at your restaurant. I appreciate the costs associated to running a restaurant like Candlenut and experiences you may have had that led you to set a minimum including the demand you have that allows you to do it.  I think that people who go to Candlenut know what it costs and it is not difficult to rake up a bill amounting to $100/person ++ or more. They will have no qualms on spending what it takes to enjoy the experience BUT without being told that they have to spend at least so much. This was what, for me, that did not sit well.  Obviously it is you prerogative to ultimately decide and here's just some input from a customer that likes Candlenut for you to consider. I hope to visit Candle nut again.

1150,70,2,2024-03-17,"We were very excited to have dinner recently at Candlenut given their Michelin review. however on the night of our dinner unknown to us the space adjacent to the dining area was simultaneously hosting a staff party for the attached hotel with incredibly loud music and speeches which drowned out any attempt at conversation - we could barely hear our waiter‚Äôs attempts to talk with us. The food was also not to a 1-Michelin star standard: the appetizers were served luke warm not hot, the tasting menu was poorly paced and the food was a let down. I emailed them regarding our experience and did not receive a reply. All in all a very dissatisfying experience given their reputation and price point.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1152,72,5,2024-03-17,We saw this place featured in an episode of Somebody Feed Phil on Netflix. It also is Michelin starred. Friendly service and a good price for somewhere like Singapore. We paid around ¬£130 GBP for dinner and two drinks. Great to try the Peranakan food - essentially the food of the Chinese who came to the peninsula hundreds of years ago.  Liked the black nut fried rice - in its raw uncooked form the nut is poisonous due to the cyanide content- clearly here after careful preparation all good. The chicken curry also highly recommended.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

The courses aren‚Äôt huge, but enough to share and enjoy as a group, we loved that! From starters to dessert, every dish had its unique taste. The service was attentive and earnest, but not pretentious, which is refreshing to see in a Michelin star experience. The place is nice, tables are spaced out, gibbing each group privacy and a quiet feel, but it doesn‚Äôt have a cozy feel. All in all the experience was really positive and at a reasonable price range. Highly recommended!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1158,78,3,2024-03-17,We took their festive tasting menu and it was pretty disappointing specially if you call it a M star 1 resturant. Pretty average food and service was horrible ( the staff was cleaning the floor while food was served. Indeed - waste of money for those who are looking for M - star experience. This should just be a casual resturant instead.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Starting with the Wing bean salad the the flavors were complex, light and refreshing. The main dishes, swimmer crab curry and Babi buah keluak pork were intense, aromatic, rich and very filling.

Service was excellent.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1166,86,5,2024-02-16,"It is a wonderful place where you can experience fine dining of Nonya food (Peranakan food), a traditional food style from Singapore and the Malay region. This is a restaurant that reinterprets local food and serves it as fine dining, rather than the French, Italian, or Japanese food that comes to mind when you think of fine dining.  The descendants of the Chinese Han people who lived in southern China and migrated to the Malay Peninsula and southern Thailand are called Peranakan. When traveling to Malaysia or Singapore, you may hear the word Nyonya or Baba, which also means that among Peranakan people, women are called Nyonya and men are called Baba.  In other words, Peranakan food is a type of food that has all the characteristics of Chinese and Southeast Asian food, and is a type of food that is difficult to experience in other regions. For that reason, Candlenut is a fine dining restaurant worth trying something new.  If you are looking for European fine dining, it would be helpful to know about Candlenut in advance because the flavor and style of the food are very different. I think it would be a good choice for people who like to experience new styles.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Our first Michelin star restaurant and worth every penny. My picky palate was blown away by food from their own family recipes even though they were simple dishes. I will never forget their desserts as well - I will be back in a heartbeat for the chendol and kueh salat omg. üò≠ Our Singapore trip was made more memorable by this restaurant and their very friendly staff.

I completely trusted the service but should‚Äôve checked more carefully when I paid. They contacted me later and the charge is returned. Very sincere.  Highly recommend and will visit again.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

I would highly recommend to anyone who loves food, to try some of the best high quality local foods here. $145 sgd is also a good price for the amount of food per person you get.

Service was impeccable ~ warm, professional, and convivial. Thank you for taking care of us so well! Food ~ must-try items were the Kueh Pie Tee, the Ngoh Hiang, & the Buah Keluak fried rice. Deserving an honourable mention is the sambal belachan, which, rightly so, is made in-house, with a good amount of spice and kick to elevate each dish. While the price may be considered above average, one mustn't forget that Nonya cuisine is often labour intensive. Simply put, Candlenut focuses on quality rather than quantity. From the execution to the delivery, I tasted passion and dedication. Thank you for making me so proud to be a Peranakan. I didn't just taste food tonight; I savoured my heritage.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Recently my friend made lunch reservation to have the Ahma-kase (It is similar with Japanese omakase) at 2:00 p.m.  She requested to add an item she really loves as the dessert. Although Candlenut only serves the item as dinner Ahma-kase, the staff (unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get her name) was helpful and checked with the chef. The chef said yes.  The surprising part, my friend said when she called in to make reservation, the staff greeted her by name.  Out of curiosity, my friend asked how she knew her name.  Apparently, Candlenut makes use of their customer information well. They put in effort to make you feel remembered and welcomed when you come back again. Amazing!  On the lunch day, we realised we could come in early. MJ, who answered my friend‚Äôs call said she would call my friend back if there is a table.  When we were on our way, MJ called and said there is a cancellation and we can come at any time.  As usual, the new Ahma-kase is as great as the previous Ahma-kase.

Opting for the tasting menu, we were treated to an exceptional culinary journey. As someone with Southeast Asian roots, I might be a bit biased, but I must say this restaurant truly stood out. It exceeded my expectations and proved deserving of its Michelin accolade.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1241,161,5,2023-10-19,"Excellent food. This was the first Michelin-star experience I had. The service was kind and attentive, very knowledgeable. The food was clearly sophisticated, but totally delicious. Be warned, it is very rich. Do not assume that just because it is gourmet, that means you'll head out for hawker food after to be full. Nope. You'll be full.  Kudos on the dessert. I NEVER would have imagined that such a combo worked but it did.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1242,162,5,2023-10-19,"My experience at candlenut was amazing! Came here for the first time in august for my birthday, and back here again to celebrate my post-wedding. Food was amazing, appreciate how its so professionally made and served, but at the same time, being able to have a taste of home and comfort. Special mention to Benjamin, the manager! He is super professional, very knowledgeable about the background of the restaurant and the dishes curated by chef Malcolm, and also EXTRA hospitable. It was truly a joy and an amazing experience in candlenut. Thank you Ben and team for the hardwork!!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

We had the ah-ma-kase. Every single dish wow-ed us, they were packed with flavours, portion size was just right and the meal felt so heartwarming!  And to top it off, the experience was made even better thanks to Felix‚Äôs impeccable service! He passionately explained every dish, he was meticulous and observant in refilling our drinks, offering us the super yummy sambal chilli, and made the effort to chat with us! When he found out that we were there for a small celebration, he surprised us with a delicious slice of Kueh Salat, which my mum really loved!  We left the restaurant with our tummies and hearts full. The experience at Candlenut was truly priceless. Thank you Felix and everyone who were hard at work! ‚ù§Ô∏è",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1247,167,3,2023-10-19,"Had very high hope given the Michelin star and so many recommended on social media. Started off strong - our server was very welcoming and knowledgeable of the cuisine/history of the restaurant. We had a big lunch around 2:30pm so we weren‚Äôt very hungry for dinner and decided to go with a la carte vs omakase. Ordered the fried bean curd roll appetizer, fried rice, curry crab and Sambal vegetables. Overall a bit too sweet for my liking but appreciated the unique character of the dishes. However the service went downhill from here. My water glass wasn‚Äôt filled for 10+ minutes until I flagged someone down. Then we waited around for another 10+ mins for our table to be cleaned and served dessert menu. Our server never stopped by once since our dishes arrived, no check-ins, no refills until the very end, she came by with the check and asked us if we wanted to join the membership‚Ä¶ obviously no lol. Mind you this is on a Wednesday night so the place was about only half full. Would recommend you try somewhere else if wanting a better service and dining experience.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Thank you, Felix!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1249,169,1,2023-10-19,Staff was extremely unprofessional when we called to ask if a walk in was possible. I don‚Äôt see how it is so difficult to just say that there are no tables available rather than giving a snarky reply about how it‚Äôs so last minute to make a booking on the day itself.

1265,185,4,2023-09-19,"Upscale Peranakan food in a relaxed setting. Known for the Prix Fixe ""Ah-ma-kase"" (omakase) $130 for lunch (including tax and service charge).  We were not super impressed with the food overall for the price. If the price was around $70, it would have been reasonable. The aroma, plating, and service were pristine. Ironically, my most favorite dish was the dessert (black glutinous rice sorbet with coconut shaved ice), followed by the starters. The main course was decent, but again, were not amazing.  The staff were very professional but friendly. They gave us an extra small dessert dish (tapioca cake) to celebrate a special occasion.  Not sure if we will come back, but if we do, we would just order from the a la carte menu, rather than the ahmakase.  Total was $150 per pax including tax/service charge.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

The food menu changes every month so I don‚Äôt bother to take photo of it but what seems interesting from last month isn‚Äôt available this month, that‚Äôs a bit annoying.  The food is good, but not great. Portion is quite small, the 3 of us (ladies) ordered a total of 6 dishes. To me the food is more similar to malay food rather than peranakan. The NgoHiang is really nothing special, I have had better.  The service on the other hand is very very good. The waiter who served us knows all the dishes well and could recommend a similar dish to replace the one no longer on the menu. Thanks! Price is steep!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

I eat dishes and rice like rice and side dishes. It tastes like curry It looks like a Malay dish but is well balanced. The vegetable dish made with what kind of grass and banana flowers was very delicious. The restaurant atmosphere is also hip. Dempsey Hill, where the restaurant is located, also has a nice atmosphere. Please visit at least once",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1270,190,5,2023-09-19,"The taste of the food was excellent, as it was selected by Michelin. I recommend it if you want to eat traditional food with the feeling of eating a very refined Hanjeongsik in Korea. The waiters' attentive service was also very touching and memorable during my trip to Singapore (other places are also friendly, but I think their service is unique). This is a place I want to revisit and relive the excitement of the day.  However, it is a bit disappointing that it is a bit far from the center and the price can be a burden.  Nevertheless, I would like to say that it is one of the best restaurants in Singapore.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1272,192,4,2023-08-20,"This is a Michelin 1-star fine dining restaurant in Dempsey Hill. I went because I thought it would be interesting to see the interpretation of Singapore's traditional food through fine dining. We had a dinner set, and for us it was a course of 4 types of amuzubushi + soup + 5 types of main dishes and rice + 3 types of dessert. The 5 types of main dishes and rice are unusual, but in Korean terms, it feels like a 5-cheop bansang, so it's a bit strange. However, if you value the feeling of developing Singapore's food culture while preserving it, it seems like a good choice. It was a meal that made me wonder what it would be like for Singaporeans to visit a formal restaurant.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1291,211,5,2023-08-20,"Candlenut, Dempsey, Singapore - this has been on my bookmark for the longest. Finally the opportunity arose. What stands out is definitely the impeccable service. It‚Äôs interesting how despite everything we ordered being curry based, they all tasted uniquely different. The beef rendang, curry chicken, and the blue swimmer crab curry were the most outstanding with decent portion sizes. The Bakwan Kepiting Soup though hearty and delicious came in a very tiny portion. It would be nicer if it was presented in a different sort of soup bowl with lid. If there is something for improvement I would say it would be the chairs. For a meal meant to be savoured with all the unique tastes coming out of the dishes, the chairs were really uncomfortable to sit for long. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a lovely meal in a lovely setting, best savoured on a lazy afternoon day.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1292,212,4,2023-08-20,"We had an underwhelming experience at Candlenut with the least satisfying part being that it was very overpriced. We ordered the tasting menu. We sat outside and the service was slow and while our waitress was very nice she had to go get an extra menu and read off the menu to describe the dishes. The chairs outside had low backs and were uncomfortable. The music sounded like hotel lobby smooth jazz and got repetitive and unenjoyable by the end of the meal. We liked the small bite sized starters but all the entrees of the tasting menu were brought out at the same time and were kind of lukewarm, it seemed like they may have been made a while ahead of time. We thought the beef short rib kapitan curry and the Babi assam were just okay, tasted kind of similar, and the flavors did not pop - really none of the entrees tasted great. The cassava kueh dessert was excellent but the bubur ketan hitam black glutinous rice sorbet dish tasted like watered down oatmeal. We paid $376 for two tasting menus and one drink each and we would have rather gone to a hawker center where we could have paid 10 times less. Perhaps it was an off night but if you are like us and only have a few nights in Singapore unfortunately we would definitely not recommend eating here based off our dinner tonight.  Update - due to a caring team and excellent customer service, we have updated the overall rating, we appreciate it.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Starting with appetisers, we had a series of small but punchy bites. The satay skewer; maimoa lamb neck with kicap manis glaze was my favourite of the three.  The mains were served family-style, aside from the Bakwan Kepiting Soup: blue crab & chicken tofu ball soup which was served individually. The five remaining dishes varied widely in terms of preparation and protein: banana blossom, duck, barramundi, squid, and ib√©rico pork.  My favourites from the entrees were the Ilan Chuan Chuan (barramundi), Telor Goreng with Tau Yu Bak (ib√©rico pork), and the Kerabu Jantung Pisang (banana blossom salad).

1304,224,5,2023-07-21,"A very satisfying gastronomic journey through Peranakan culture from beginning to end. Throughout the 11-item ah-ma-kase curated meal, I was transported to a special place where Chinese, Indonesian, and Malay cuisines meld harmoniously, accentuated by modern Western techniques in some dishes. The flavours and textures of every one is spot on and memorable, well-portioned to prevent bloating, and incredibly cooked.  From the moment the appetisers were served, one could already taste the amount of care that went into crafting every morsel. The lobster kuih pai tee was succulent and fresh, flavoured with hints of citrus and coconut. The buah keluak fried carrot cake cube was a delight, delicate yet intensely bringing out the signature Peranakan ingredient. Just when you thought you needed something lighter from the bursts of flavour in the starters, a light chicken broth with crab meatballs and tofu is served.  I cannot begin to comprehend or guess the gorgeous blend of spices in the rempahs that went into the main dishes. Each one was unique and paired perfectly with steamed rice - whether it is a creamy coconut curry with squid and sweet potato leaves, a sweeter red chili paste with the chicken, umami-rich tau you bak (stewed pork in dark soy sauce) with onsen eggs, sour and spicy gravy with thick white fish, or a refreshingly light and zesty chicken salad. Perhaps, it is the sense of mystery that makes the food so compelling. To top it all off, a cooling dessert of bur bur cha cha with coconut sorbet was served, with a pumpkin ondeh-ondeh, both of which light but cleansed the palette with sweet, fragrant notes.  The lofty setting, beautiful cutlery, and friendly service were the icing on the cake. I wish more Michelin Stars are awarded to such establishments that champion authentic local cuisine with a rich culture to tell.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

This place is one good option perfect for special occasions.  Food is not great but too excellent. In fact we had just been to food heaven. It was my partner's birthday and this was certainly a very nice restaurant to dine at.  We ordered ala-carte dishes (3 mains, 1 appetizer and 1 Dessert). Ala-carte dish portion is meant for sharing between 2 persons. We had the Ngoh Hiang, Chef Mum's Chicken Curry, Westholme Wagyu Beef Rib Rendang, Chap Chye and finished off with the best chendol I have ever eaten in the world (Candlenut's Chendol) - This is even better than the famous Melaka Chendol. A dessert you must save stomach space for and definitely order.  All dishes were heavenly mouthwatering decadence. No regrets!

1322,242,4,2024-06-15,"The food was excellent! Our only suggestion on the tasting menu is to not serve the main courses family style. Peranakan cuisine have some bold flavors and it was a little awkward trying to navigate through 6 plates all at once. Although the food was still incredible, I wondered if this took away from the ""bonus"" acclaim or ovation each dish deserved. Service was a little hit & miss for a Michelin Star restaurant. D√©cor was also slightly underwhelming as our view from the table had one of us looking at a stack of chairs piled in the corner. All together I'd still recommend this spot to anyone wanting to experience elevated Peranakan food. Definitely the best we've had in Singapore!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1333,253,1,2024-06-15,Avoid this place if you are looking for a 1 Michelin star dining experience.  Hard to believe that this established has maintained their star over a number of years.  100% agree with all the 1 star ratings on google. Consistent messaging coming from experienced diners who still have quality standards.  Overall quality of food is good but nothing special. Lamb meat was cold and the staff‚Äôs explanation was that in Peranakan cuisine the sauces are served luke warm to unleash all the flavors.  Overpriced for the value provided.  Service trying their best but still sloppy and not Michelin star worthy. Questionable ambiance with music coming from the restaurant ‚Äúnext door‚Äù (there are no doors unfortunately).  Unfortunately a waste of money and high opportunity costs as we could have spent the night at a different better restaurant,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1334,254,5,2024-06-15,Good experience. Nice decor and ambience. Service staff were amazing. Food was decently good too.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1335,255,5,2024-06-15,I‚Äôve been to restaurants all over all the world and this is my favorite. My wife and I did the tasting menu and it was amazing. Servings were generous and flavors were unique and bold.   I think it is worth flying from the US to Singapore just to eat at Candlenut and experience Michelin star Peranakan cuisine.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1336,256,3,2024-06-15,"Good food, beautiful Peranakan interior design and friendly service. We tried 2 starters, 5 mains and 3 desserts, and our overall verdict is that whilst the food is good, it is nothing spectacular except for one dish: The blue swimmer crab curry. This curry was fantastic and showcased a true mastery of flavor. The wagyu beef rendang was also very delicious and tender. Sadly, the assam sotong was chewy and overcooked.  The service was very attentive but too fast in clearing the plates, so much so that we felt rushed throughout the entire evening. Further, the temperature was very cold and there was a strong airflow from the air-con.  All in all, tasty food but not the Michelin star experience one expects and thus the pricing is not justifiable.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1337,257,3,2024-06-15,"Well prepared dishes, but the flavor of the raw materials is always completely covered by a mix of spices, so everything has the same taste in the end. Approximate service and location shared with other restaurants in a resort. In short, for the price paid (around 300 euros for two for the tasting menu, with a bottle of non-standard French ros√© paid 70 euros), we expected more. It certainly has nothing to do with a European Michelin-starred restaurant, in terms of culinary offerings and quality of service.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1338,258,5,2024-06-15,"Being a fan of Peranakan food, I came to this restaurant with high expectations given that they have received 1 Michelin star rating for 5 years running.  We had the Taste of Candlenut menu. There are 13 dishes in all, but the portions are small. What we liked about this menu is that Chef Malcolm and team has injected creativity to modernize Peranakan dishes.  Quality of food was very good. Service was great as the wait staff are friendly and helpful. I will certainly cone back for their ala carte menu that features more of the conventional Peranakan dishes.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1339,259,5,2024-06-15,"The restaurant is located inside COMO at Dempsey, sharing space with a few other restaurants. It  was awarded one Michelin star for a few consecutive years. Do make an early reservation to secure a spot to dine-in.  The food is excellent. I tried quite a few dishes to share: 1. Bakwan Kepiting Soup -- The bakwan itself is quite chunky. The soup broth is quite light tasting, but still tasty.  2. Pork Satay - The pork satay was extremely tender. The sauce was sweet with some herbs on it.  3. Chap Chye -- The chap chye was very tasty -- it had cabbage, beancurd skin, pork slices, simmered in a prawn-pork based broth.  4. Beef Rib Rendang -- The beef was cooked to become very tender. The rendang gravy itself was very fragrant and had quite a ""paste""-like consistency.  5. Babi Buah Keluak -- The pork was tender and the keluak seasoning was slightly spicy, but was very tasty.  6. Blue Swimmer Crab Curry -- The crab chunks were quite generous. The curry itself was quite thick and creamy, but was well-balanced with the acidic flavor in it.  They also offer some vegetarian options: 1. Sambal Four Heavenly Kings -- Okra, brinjal, long beans, and kangkong were tossed in sambal. The sambal was slightly spicy but very fragrant.  2. Eggplant Serunding -- The eggplant was lightly fried. The serunding had a 'rougher' texture and was well seasoned -- slightly salty, slightly sweet -- very well balanced.  They also have quite a few dessert offerings: 1. Buah Keluak Ice Cream -- It was excellent. The buah keluak gave a salty-savory tinge, which is well contrasted to the richness of the chocolate in the ice cream.  2. Chendol -- The chendol, instead of laid on a bed of ice, was laid on a bed of coconut shavings. It is then drizzled with the gula melaka syrup, good for a sweet ending.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

After tasting every dish with careful examination, most of their dish has a distinctive spice and herbal flavour, which you would not find such a unique combination in another restaurant.

1366,286,5,2024-06-15,"//Updated Review//  Initially this was a 1 star review following a disappointing tasting menu at the Audra x Candlenut collab in March. We shared the feedback with Candlenut and they responded like true professionals asking us to return and try the standard tasting menu with their compliments.  We returned last night and it was instantly a better experience. Instead of a celebrity soaked non-stop photo shoot, Candlenut was in full form restaurant mode. The table staff were welcoming, knowledgeable and great at making us feel at ease despite knowing we were previously unhappy returnees.  The March tasting menu was an interesting collection of Peranakan dishes, my favourite of which was the Boston lobster appetiser, the king prawn, and the pumpkin ondeh-ondeh.  The food was still a little on the tepid side, the beef rib curry especially could have been served much hotter (cold curry doesn‚Äôt settle well on the stomach). The chef‚Äôs insistence that food should be served a little cold reminds me of the  story of the Emperor‚Äôs new clothes.  Given the sterling efforts of the restaurant team, this has earned 5 stars. For the food to match, chef, please let customers eat it hot.  Thank you for inviting us back Candlenut!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1372,292,3,2024-06-15,"Giving the Candlenut a 3 out of 5 because price in relation to food quality, portion and taste were disproportionate. We had the Bakwan Kepiting soup, wing bean salad, sweet corn and mizuna salad, chap chye, ikan assam pedas, westholme wagyu beef rendang, Chincalok omelette, assam sotong, buah keluak ice cream, chendol and kueh platte  Ambience was nice with high ceilings and simple decorations but I won‚Äôt say the chairs were particularly comfortable. Lighting was dim but natural light helped so it wasn‚Äôt challenging to see what we were eating.  For food, I can only recommend the bakwan kepiting soup, wing bean salad, chap chye and buah keluak ice cream. The buah keluak ice cream was the ultimate star and sadly the only star dish, which makes the experience at candlenut a tad disappointing. Not many photos to share because plating was nothing to shout about because it all just came in bowls with serving cutlery.  Service was definitely good but overall, being in Singapore and going to a restaurant is about have a sublime food experience - everything else should complement it to make it memorable not the other way round. If you really want to try candlenut, I suggest sticking to the few dish I suggested above.  Oh we also had sparkling sake which was pretty good but really subjective to a person‚Äôs preference.

I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, and I found some of the dishes to be a little spicy but in line with what I was expecting. It was all served with rice, which I was able to use to cool down my palate between bites.  The dessert was also imaginative and delicious!

The service was excellent.  The main server, staff, and manager (Gerry Bee) made our dining experience memorable.  I recommend Candlenut to anyone visiting Singapore.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

It was very tasty and very, very good‚Äîan excellent introduction to Peranakan food. With our meal, we had Candlenut Bespoke tea (S$10): oolong, butterfly pea flower with notes of jasmine and pandan. Audre liked it and thought it had taste. Dimitri didn‚Äôt. The starters were fun and yummy. We were introduced to candlenut and to the poison nut, pangium. The A5 Wagyu beef satay was tasty and tender. Of the six main dishes, our favorite dish was Udand Nanas--the pineapple curry‚Äîand it was delicious in the lemak sauce with laksa leaf. The other favorite was called Kay Batok a charcoal grilled Teoh Thyme San chicken marinated in spices and coconut milk with belimbing sambal. Just to name two favorites does not do justice to the excellent meal. YUM! The desserts were very good too. Audre really liked the ginger espuma and the coconut cream.

1431,351,1,2024-06-15,"Expectations were very high considering it's a Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant. However, it was very disappointing. We did the tasting menu, but they didn't have a beverage pairing or a sommelier.  Then the food started coming out four plates at a time and it was all cold. Getting four dishes at a time was an extremely fast pace and the food being cold was terrible.  The location is also strange - it's joined to other restaurants and shops so you don't get an intimate setting.  I recommend splurging more and going to Zen instead.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

The hotel decoration is average, but clean and tidy. Every dish is presented and presented very well. Most of them taste good. The most amazing thing for me is the first Xiaojinbei, which is really delicious. The fried rice I ordered for my baby was unexpectedly delicious, which was an unexpected surprise. You can see the chef's great care in making every dish. The service is pretty good. There is Chinese service but no Chinese menu.

1435,355,4,2024-06-15,"Date of visit : 14 Jan 2023 Time : 8.15 pm  3 restaurants are in the same block BLK 17. If you enter via the main door in the centre, it‚Äôs the Japanese eatery squeezed in between the Dempsey Cookhouse on the left and Candlenut on the right.  Arrived without reservation. The Cookhouse was full, so tried Candlenut. Understand that it‚Äôs a 1 * Michelin restaurant.  Service is impeccable. Everyone is courteous and knowledgeable about the food.  We were told that portions are small and to take 4-6 dishes for 2 pax.  Knowing Peranakan food, which is abound with spices, we ordered only 2, with rice each.  The grilled red snapper is excellent.  The beef rendang is just good. It is torn into shreds and lacks the chewiness related to beef shin meat. The spices could be overwhelming for some.  The 2 dishes are more than enough for 2 pax, though the grilled fish portion is too little.  The durian pancake roll is good.  All in all a good first time experience in a Michelin restaurant.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1436,356,5,2024-06-15,"It was excellent experience. This place is famous for 'Peranacan' culture. I tried to know their culture and food. Their food was excellent and the server who came from Penang, Malaysia was even more excellent. He knew the culture very well and explained perfectly. The explanations of food and 'Rosak' culture were so satisfying. When you want to Rosak, then you should go 'Candlenut'.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1437,357,4,2024-06-15,"My enduring feeling after two meals here is that the food is good, but there‚Äôs a lack of generosity.

In addition to him we were serviced by other staff members who also did an excellent job, you can tell this restaurant trains their staff well (and/or hires brilliant staff).

Main: rendang was not too spicy (I think you may be able to request more spicier if you'd like) and squid ink was unique.  Service was exceptional and very professional  Place was aesthetically decorated. Perfect to have a date night, family dinner, or even just to chill around and have a nice and delicate food.  they may have seasonal menu towards the Christmas but overall it's good.

The minimum was waived however this is Singapore where large families exist. For these nonsensical policies, not worth it.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1459,379,2,2024-06-15,"Has a policy of minimum spend $150 when dining 7pax or more. This policy is ridiculous as the average pricing of dishes are 30-40. The staff waived the fee kindly, however, one of the managers (did not get her name) an eurasian female, that took to our issue, was snarky and dismissive.

The menu says starters and mains but our clever server wanted to serve the mains before the starter. That in my view beats the whole purpose of calling them starters. Service here is at best one notch over the hawker center service. No wine list offered also no suggestions made may be I‚Äôm wrong but thought the recommendations are normal part of the restaurant business here the guys  just look at you blankly. Food is very average it‚Äôs not wow at all..Over  all experience thumbs down. And don‚Äôt waste your time,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1479,399,1,2024-06-15,Service is worse than the hawker center. The shocking part is it has one Michelin star and they want to serve the main course before the starters. They don‚Äôt provide the wine list till asked for. Untrained staff  give that a 2/10 Food very average not something to rave about 4/10.

1511,431,2,2024-06-15,"First the good things: The staff were friendly and doing their best, the location was well decorated and plating was elegant. Unfortunately, that was about it.  I went here with my family and grandmother and even though the food was ok, we really weren't impressed.  The ""private dining"" experience is a crammed, claustrophobia-inducing room, so try to get a seat either in the main dining area or outside.  We opted for the, while pricey still quite moderately expensive for a Michelin starred restaurant, tasting menu. You can tell that the chef is simply trying to elevate traditional cuisine and introduce an artificial ""theme"" into the menu. We were unlucky enough to catch the fish. Everything from satay to rendang was fish, regardless of whether it created a cohesive experience. It was all ok, but to put it like my grandmother (who is Peranakan) 'It's all ok-la, but the market is better'.  At Candlenut you trade traditional quality for wagyu beef and Boston lobster.  Though to be fair, both the starters, which were more reminiscent of an amuse bouche, and the deserts were good.  The wine was grossly overpriced, but the selection was ok, probably owing, at least in part, to their affiliation with COMO.  I talked to some friends, and the general consensus is that since Candlenuts acquisition by the luxury hotel group COMO a few years back, the quality and authenticity have reduced in favour of amenities such as the aforementioned wagyu and lobster. Don't get me wrong, I love both. But they just aren't the right fit for Candlenut.  Apart from that, you have to understand that COMO at Dempsey is an entire complex including a Dover Street Market, probably Singapores most expensive grocery market and florist and an entire array of various restaurants, lined up in just two, granted elegant, buildings. This conveys a very strong sense of a tasteless rich-kid bubble.  Altogether a terribly underwhelming and grossly overpriced experience. Would not recommend.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1512,432,3,2024-06-15,"The food is great but service is terrible, staff watch over you like jackals and swoop in at every opening: you finish a satay, they ask to take the stick, slow eaters end up eating by themselves with only a plate, fork and spoon, everything else has been taken away, the rest of your party sit at empty table looking at you eat. You feel rushed to leave from the very first dish you receive. But the food is really good.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1513,433,5,2024-06-15,"This place was recommended to us by a Singaporean friend. This was a new cuisine type for us- and it was sensational. We had the chicken curry and beef rendang, as well as the salad. They staff were fantastic- so welcoming and friendly. The venue was beautiful too. Highly recommend.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1514,434,5,2024-06-15,The best chicken curry I‚Äôve ever had.  The service was also brilliant in a stunning location/setting.  Next time in Singapore we‚Äôll be straight back!  Thanks,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1515,435,5,2024-06-15,Book your reservation now! Such a wonderful experience! The food was absolutely incredible. The best Michelin experience I‚Äôve had. The restaurant is stunning. Arvin took care of us and he was so knowledgeable and really made us feel connected to the cuisine and the culture. We left and immediately recommended Candlenut to a few friends visiting Singapore in the coming weeks. I will dream about this experience until the next time I‚Äôm lucky enough to go again!,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1516,436,5,2024-06-15,"We went for the lunch tasting menu, which was composed of not fancy dishes, but rather ordinary Peranakan classics presented in a contemporary yet authentic approach. We asked for more rice so we could finish the tasty saucy main courses. The highlight was the buah keluak (which I had to try because of the unique ingredient and preparation technique) and the black sesame creme with coconut (I can't find any words to describe the taste of this). The staff were attentive and helpful, I really appreciated how they brought a short side table for me to keep my purse and that the manager passed by to check on us once in a while during our meal. I enjoyed each and every time from the menu. It was exceptional value for money, at times can be cheaper than an ordinary Peranakan restaurant. The tasting menu items got updated from time to time so that makes it a good reason to come back here often. The interior design for me was not outstanding. Personally I would prefer to let more natural sunlight in the main dining hall, it was quite dark for me despite dining during day time.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1521,441,1,2024-06-15,"Had the tasting menu today for a special occasion  Last minute change to the tasting menu, the babi wasn‚Äôt available and changed to a beef cheek rendang. I had no clue what the dish was, because apparently, neither did the server. His words were it‚Äôs a new change I didn‚Äôt even have time to memorise it.  My best guess was that it‚Äôs a beef cheek rendang, with a aggressively bitter rempah from burning the base spices 6 ways to sunday.  Only dish that came warm was the sotong curry.  Most dishes were criminally underseasoned, as if salt was the main casualty from post covid inflation and the cook on the appetiser station had both hands in a handcuff. If you need a lesson in seasoning, I‚Äôm more than qualified to do so.  I highly recommend that everyone reads this review before blowing $300 on a place that bills it‚Äôs as a modern Peranakan restaurant that can‚Äôt figure out how to put hot food on hot plates.  Middle aged manager tried to clear the table while I was done but my girlfriend was still eating, I‚Äôm not sure about the shuttle bus schedule but I‚Äôm sure he would be early enough to clear my table and still make it for the last bus considering it was only 7pm.  My front/ back waiter couldn‚Äôt clear my two top with a tray, and had to make two passes and repeatedly couldn‚Äôt clear empty dishes and drinkware.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

The way that the menu was put together and the symphony of tastes and textures made this meal so, so special. Each item on the tasting menu was carefully thought out and was made to play a role in the beautiful orchestral movement that was the entire tasting menu. To top it off, the chef stopped by to say hi and we got to chat a little bit about the food and the inspirations behind it. Service was great but the food was to die for.

Service was impeccable, especially our waitress Jerribee who was so friendly, warm and welcoming. The dishes we had were great as well (although naturally every peranakan family will always think that theirs tastes the best :p). Our favourite main was the blue crab curry and the kueh salat was probably one of the best we‚Äôve had with its silky smooth custard. We over-ordered and requested to take away 4 dishes which a new staff accidentally discarded. However without any prompting, the chef remade full portions of all 4 dishes for us to take home! Service like this really warms your heart and makes an experience like this unforgettable. Will definitely be back again!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1574,494,4,2024-06-15,"After watching the documentary about chef Malcolm Lee taking Peranakan food to a new level, being awarded a first Michelin star, and needing 3 weeks to get a table, the expectations unavoidably were raised beyond the height of Dempsey Hill. We ordered the tasting menu, which was the longest I have seen in any restaurant, just to be sure they will hit us with their best shot. To begin with, the appetizers, which came in a set of four, didn't disappoint. However, after the promising start came the soup and five main courses. Well, if these were supposed to raise our taste buds to a new level, they surely fell flat back to what we can find in the hawker center on Adam road. I am not saying the dishes weren't tasty, but I surely would have expected something more outstanding in term of culinary creativity than what I probably could cook from some NTUC packs. The five small desserts were good, not too sweet, but maybe one notch above Bengawan Solo, not more. Were we underwhelmed? You bet! Maybe we set the expectations too high, but to be honest, it was good, but not to a level I will remember. Malcolm Lee is without doubt a talented chef, but the menu seems like he got back to be a bit conservative rather than taking his culinary skills to a level that can seriously wow his audience. Maybe his clientele is not ready for something more contemporary and daring, but in a place like Dempsey Hill, he surely could have taken some more risks. Sadly now it rather feels like he is trying to pack his restaurant from the fame of the Michelin award...",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1594,514,5,2022-06-16,"The entire experience here was fantastic, from our awesome server Arvin, who provided attentive and friendly service, to the amazing Peranakan cuisine!  The tasting menu was more than enough food, and provided a great selection of different flavours.  Will be making this a must visit for my trips to Singapore.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1595,515,4,2022-06-16,"The upper echelons of peranakan cuisine displayed. The pairing of fine dining and singapore local delicacy was so refined that it surprised me. Highly recommended!  There was still stigma of traditional peranakan that I felt lacking some where. Nonetheless, a great restaurant with great table service and staff.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1596,516,5,2022-06-16,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore!!  It was my first time having Peranakan food and now I can‚Äôt wait for the next! Each dish was delicious and unique, and there were some flavours I had never tasted before. It was an absolute symphony of a meal and has stood the test of time in my memory. I recommend it as an essential part of a visit to Singapore, and of course for any locals too!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1597,517,5,2022-06-16,"Great Peranakan food served at Candlenut! I like the ambience in the restaurant üíØ and the service crew displayed great enthusiasm in providing a good dinner service throughout the meal. Shout out to yommy for the great hospitality! Tried the tasting menu ($118++) and i will say i enjoy the Amuse-bouche (snacks) alot! One bite and will make you yearn for more!!  For the mains, all the items are done well and there isn't any moment that you will feel jerlak.    The food is not overly spicy spicy kind but more of lemak. You can take portion of the mains and pair it along with the rice they served. But for 2 person, it is quite filling towards the end.  For the desserts, you will be in for sweet treats! And you will get to hear story on the kuah kelak from yommy! Will definitely return again!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1599,519,5,2022-06-16,"Been to Candlenut a few times. I've always enjoy coming here because Peranakan food is so close to my heart and Candlenut is really special. The high ceilings and slightly modern yet rustic decor hints heavily that this isn't your typical traditional Nyonya fare.  Proud of the fact that Candlenut is the first Peranakan restaurant to ever get one Michelin star, and has placed this unique Southeast Asian cuisine and Singapore on the world map. The food here under chef Malcolm Lee is always complex yet soulful. I definitely recommend getting the Tasting menu over the A La Carte menu.  Service here is wonderful. Staff are always attentive and warm. They also really take the time to explain the food served in detail. I celebrated a few of my friends' birthday here and they've always thrown in a surprise for the birthday person, which is always, highly appreciated!  I would definitely recommend making reservations early in advance.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1601,521,3,2022-06-16,"Good service and explanations about the dishes, but some dishes were lukewarm‚Ä¶Ôºàmaybe That‚Äôs the traditional way? Just my own opinion haha) mains also were a bit bland imo, but that‚Äôs subjective",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1602,522,5,2022-06-16,"Lucky to get a table for 6pm as it is always full. Being the first time there we were recommended some dishes.   We had the pork neck satay for a start.  It well spiced.  Meat was tender and juicy.  However a little salty for our taste as we eat rather bland food  normally.  Nonetheless still good with our red wine recommended by Ryan.  Our other dishes came together with our brown rice.  The wagyu beef curry was exceptional.  I am all for the sauce.  It was so delicately flavored and there are also shredded coconut to chew onüòãüòã.  Our sotong was good too.  It  has a little sour taste to it making it so appetizing.   Our sambal mixed veggies came.  Though it was tasty, it is still on the salty side for us.  So we decided to pack and take it home with us instead.  We then order a ngor hiang to go with our wine.  It was good.  Not heavy like the traditional ones.  It was hot, crispy and good. Ryan gave us excellent service.  So our overall experience was great.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1603,523,5,2022-06-16,Came with my in-laws and family. Requested for a pescatarian diet for myself a week in advance and candlenut kindly agreed to do so. Loved the special tasting platter provided for me.  Excellent table service and friendly waiters.,Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1604,524,5,2022-06-16,"In my opinion, the best Peranakan Food you ever experienced in Singapore.  This beautiful gem in Dempsey took the Peranakan Classic to another level by providing humble Peranakan dish and execute it using the best possible ingredients that they can.  I been there numerous time and it has never disappoint me at all. Worth all the penny that you spent.  Menu changes regularly if you choose the tasting menu. However, if you choose the ala carte dishes, try their wagyu beef Rendang, blue Swimmer Crab yellow Curry and their famous Buah Keluak Nasi Goreng.  The only issue is that Dempsey is very ulu. So having a private transport definitely saves all the trouble and the car park there is free.  Taking public transport is alright however it‚Äôs gonna take 5-10mins walk to the restaurant on a steep slope depending on how fast you can walk.  Other than that, enjoy your time there and don‚Äôt forget to get some of their wide range of excellent teas!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1605,525,4,2022-06-16,"Great food experience üòÄ. Undoubtedly the taste was true to its peranakan authenticity.  But you guys should work on the decor, can have your own separate toilet and not the shared one with other restaurants. #genuinefeedback :))",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1606,526,4,2022-06-16,"Good experience although the fried chicken dish  was not very good at all, the chicken was cold, not very crunchy and not sure why the tomato and cucumber relish was on the plate as it didnt add any flavour. The rempah for the fried fish was lacking flavour and was expecting it to be spicier. The Roti Jala lamb curry and prawns in lemak sauce were the top dishes. All the Dessert's were great.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

We took some time to decide on the order and was glad that the waiter gave us recommendation to take 1 set dinner with ala carte to accommodate to my little girl. The set dinner individual portion was like fine dinning portion. Each of the food is really nicely cooked. However coming home and looking through the photos again, then realized that one of the dishes were missed serving. Felt disappointed as the price of the set dinner is quite expensive and it‚Äôs from such a high-end restaurant.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1637,557,5,2022-06-16,"The food was incredible as usual. The Babi buah keluak was not as tender as we remembered but as soon we raised it with the staff, the dish was immediately replaced with a custom made dish that was amazing. We didn't know this but Candlenut serves up its own blend of house tea. They very kindly provided us with a complimentary pot of house tea and we loved it enough that we purchased the tea leaves! When it comes to service, every restaurant should take a leaf out of Candlenut's book. The service was impeccable. Truly without a fault. Everyone was so warm, attentive and eager to serve. It truly was a dinner and an evening to remember.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1648,568,5,2022-06-16,"This restaurant feels close to the heart. I have dined here some years ago when they first gained their Michelin star and had it in good memories so I had to revisit eventually. Here is what I can say:  The two of us opted¬†for the ""Taste of Candlenut"" tasting menu. We were presented with three flights of dishes, following a starters/mains/desserts logic. Each flight, for the lack of a better wording, consisted of several small plates, so in total this adds up to quite a number of individual dishes. Which is great, as the food here is just phantastic. It's genuine, sincere and heartwarming and at the same time forward looking and cosmopolitan. I wish more chefs would have the vision to combine culinary heritage with contemporary gastronomy in such a meaningful way as it is done here.  We opted for non alcoholic beverages and there is a decent selection of mocktails and teas to choose from. On any other night I¬¥d go with their selection of craft beers which must pair well with the at times spicy dishes.  The staff we interacted with was lovely and clearly enthusiastic about the restaurant and cuisine, which¬†made dinner here even more enjoyable.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1654,574,5,2022-06-16,"It's our wedding anniversary today and we decided to try a new cuisine (Peranakan). I made a reservation for lunch here and  honestly, i made the right choice.  First of all,  the staffs were attentive and warm. They always check on you and how was the food. We opted for the February tasting menu so we can have a taste of the dishes as many as possible üòç.  From appetizers to mains to dessert, all were well served and couldnt get over taking photos üòÅ. Each dish was  with unique taste and brings back old memories (for me). The taste lingers in your mouth.  Their serving was enough for 2. Initially when I think of tasting menu, i expect that the portion will not make me full but in Candlenut, you will start to feel full at the middle of the mains.  And talk about the worth of your money,  i wouldn't say it's pricey with the quality of food they serve. The  place was clean and nice deco (instagrammable ü§©).  I highly recommend Candlenut for special occasions, dates, family gatherings, and even when you have guests from other countries. A must try!

The rojak that consisted of sweet corn and spinach was a pretty interesting version of the usual ones we find in the hawker centre.

1702,622,5,2022-06-16,"I brought my dad to candlenut as a birthday treat, and  we had the December set lunch. Food was great as usual. The kueh pie tee was delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised by the muscat and persimmon granita dessert.  The service was impeccable. We‚Äôve visited many other restaurants and we can safely say that the service we‚Äôve experienced at Candlenut has been the best. Staff were extremely attentive, when I say attentive, I mean attentive. They see you struggling with a fork and spoon? They immediately offer a knife. They see you taking photos? They offer to take photos for you.  They knew it was my dad‚Äôs birthday so they gave him a complimentary cake- it was a really delicious slice of kueh salat - to blow out a candle to. They saw him looking at the menu a couple of times? They gave him a signed copy of the menu by the chef to take home as a keepsake, and even a small sampler bag of tea to try!  Staff at Candlenut: You have made my dad‚Äôs birthday a simple unforgettable experience. Thank you so much!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill
1703,623,3,2022-06-16,"Candlenut is almost always crowded, but unfortunately the food doesn't live up to the hype that surrounds this one Michelin star restaurant.  On my last couple of visits, I found that the flavours were lacking. Execution was decent but ultimately the food just tasted like it could be easily found elsewhere, with nothing really unique to keep me coming back. Portions are also small and a meal tends to get quite pricey.  Still, you may want to visit once just to see what the fuss is all about, but I would not return thereafter.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

We tried the pork satay, wing bean salad, chicken curry, crab curry (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), buah keluak fried rice, and ikan bakar (red snapper). For dessert, we tried chendol (very unique and innovative), kueh salat, and durian coconut crepe roll. The flavors are explosive and work in harmony. The service is exemplary. 10/10.

As a Michelin star place and for the price kind of expected EVERYTHING to blow my mind and thought I would really enjoy it but ended up only half the things were great and the others just whatever. Got the december tasting menu and a few other items. They do their curry really well so try that. The blue crab curry was fantastic.

1736,656,5,2022-06-16,"Candlenut is the world‚Äôs first Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant. They serve very traditional Straits-Chinese Cuisines - authentic and contemporary style. Really hard to find superb Peranakan cuisines within Singapore nowadays (if you know of any more please hit me up with some recommendations!) which bears the heart and soul of true Peranakan taste. Chef-Owner Malcolm Lee at Candlenut does it very well in this aspect, bringing a very refreshing and modern take to his menu. Overall, spices were of the right intensity and all flavors were on point.  What I have heard is that all spices and pastes are homemade from scratch without any preservatives being used - this is a very consistent quality from all his dishes which I truly appreciate and respect. All ingredients are really fresh and brings a pleasant twist of flavors when done up together to form a dish.  Tried the Blue Swimmer Crab Curry here - tumeric with galangal, coconut milk and lime leaf. Flesh is sweet and tender, cooked to utmost perfection paired with Ikan Chuan Chuan (Red Lion Snapper Fillet coated in aromatic fermented soy bean - classic Peranakan dish) and their signature Vegetable Curry with Thai Hom Mali Rice. The Westholme Wagyu Beef Rendang is a particular standout, full of flavour that typifies the very best of Peranakan cuisine. The meat, which is perfumed with fennel, coriander seed, cumin seed and black pepper is cooked for two to three hours. The luscious chunks of beef ribs are topped with serunding (fried shredded coconut) and slivers of turmeric leaf.  I ordered takeaway so cannot really comment on the atmosphere or the service level of each staff member. I do know this place at COMO Dempsey can get crowded very quickly so do make your bookings in advance. However, the ordering process was seamless and the takeaway menu is also well-presented, detailed and proper. Definitely suitable for all occasions - birthdays, anniversaries, or just a casual dining meal. Prices are on the expensive side but you get top quality for what you pay for so no complaints at all. They do have set menus as well for lunch/dinner so that might be more worth the money. A worthy recommendation for foreign friends who are visiting our tiny island and all friends who are up for a well-balanced traditional Peranakan fare with a modern twist of presentation and cooking style! :)",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1738,658,5,2022-06-16,"SUMMARY Everything in this place is good, with the exception of the dessert. Although it seems more pricy do go for their signature crab curry dish. The amount of crab meat is just wild.  SERVICE Decent - although my partner felt there was too many staff and she felt like they were staring. It might be worth to address this. On a positive note I did ask the staff a question on the food and they even brought out the raw vegetable from the kitchen so I can have a look myself.  FOOD Everything I tried (with the exception of dessert) was soo good. This is a solid 5 stars regardless of the just decent service.  DRINKS We just had tap water. Most people around us ordered red and white wine.  AMBIENCE A bit lacklustre. Although the grandeur of the building does strike a chord with me, at the same time the way they have separated the room into different restaurants takes away the premium feel this kind of place (=FOOD) deserves.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1740,660,5,2022-06-16,"Celebrated my husband's 60th birthday with a special ahma-kase tasting menu ($98++/pax) gifted by our beloved no 1. Love the decor the minute we walked in. The extremely high ceiling with prominent pillars, black timber beams on the roof and rows of rustic rushes lanterns give a romantic resort feel. Being 60, we needed a bit more light so the wait staff kindly suggested adding candles to our table. He even told us we had the most romantic table in the restaurant. Haha üòÅ For starters, I really like the tiny pie tee shells but wish there were at least 2 per person. The turnip was very well cooked and went well with the chilli. Perhaps a little prawn on top of the pie tee will enhance the taste? For the carrot cake cubes, I didn't quite taste the Buah keluak although it was heaped on top. Perhaps because the cube was cold? My favourite starter is the milkfish 'satay'. Waaahhh very delicious. I can eat 6 of these. The achar roll was a surprise as it was quite tart. Not too bad. Then the mains came. My top favourite is the Assam prawns. Very big and juicy covered in a yummy tamarind sauce plumped up with onions. 2 each. I'm happy. The Barramundi cooked in Nonya style was delicious as the white meat was so tender and went well with the sauce. The mussels were cooked in a very lemak sauce which hubby poured over his rice. Quite many mussels but both of us had a couple which tasted a bit off. I pried 1 out of a closed shell. Ate it and spat out. Strange because the majority tasted really good. The pig stomach's soup was spicy but I'd have prefer it with more kick. Lots of small slices of stomach accompanied 2 meatballs. That was nice. I didn't really like the jackfruit and jambu kerabau which was a salad. I'd have much preferred a vegetable dish like chap chye or sambal terong or sambal bendi. The least liked dish was the lamb curry. Hubby thought it was beef and I found it tough. The highlight of the meal was the dessert platter. Both hubby and I like the little kuehs very much. Being of my no dairy requirement, I had a kueh salat. Delicious. Hubby's tiny birthday cakes were soft pink and mousse-like. Forgot to ask about the flavour. We love it. Overall, we had a great time from start to finish. All the wait staff were attentive, friendly, warm and personable. The waitress who attended to us took numerous photos like a pro and consistently topped up our glasses. I overheard the manager talking with the staff about orders and operations and must commend him on maintaining a tight ship efficiently while showing respect for his colleagues. Everyone worked so well together with smiles and nice banter. Love the cosy atmosphere the staff exuded. Well done for giving my hubby and I a wonderful celebration.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

1837,757,4,2021-06-16,"Went to Candlenut for the 1st time attending a wedding.  I've always love peranakan food. So much depth and flavour in each dish.  I enjoyed all the dishes but you know, as much as I would like to be fair, some just stand out way more than others - I guess am ranking the dishes!  Wagyu beef rib rendang - Woah!!!  meat was so tender and the fats just melts in your mouth. Worth the calories.  Blue swimmer crab curry - I love eating crabs,  a good marriage of crabs and curry.  Won't say no to it,  just wish there was more crab meat in the curry... Greedy, I know.  Gula melaka prawn - coconut gravy goes perfectly well with rice, probably ate too much rice - prawns were a little tough though.  Babi buah keluak - buah keluak is a must have in pernakan food. Pork was tender. I would say this dish is an underdog.  Wok fried sambal ""Four heavenly King"" - the only vegetable dish that you won't have to force me to eat... I love all the vegetables in there.  Local red snapper, ginger, tau cheo - Am not a fish person... That's probably subconsciously it's the last on my list. Don't get me wrong, it is nice but just not on my must eat list. Tau cheo made the dish a little too salty for my liking.  Overall, I like it. I would recommend that you give it a try if you love peranakan food like I do.  I hope the dishes are named correctly in the photos... Somehow am having difficulty tapping the photo and writing in the 'What's in the photo' box.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

They looked nice but there was no wow moment in terms of quality considering its Michelin 1 star and so expensive . I can easily find other peranakan restaurants that serve food with better taste for much lower price. The restaurant atmosphere is also just so-so. It did not match our expectation of a high end restaurant. It doesn‚Äôt have its own restaurant space ... and at the end corner of the building that looks dark and less grand comparing to the other end .Overall experience was somehow disappointed. So no, I won‚Äôt come back as it doesn‚Äôt match my expectation for that pricing. All 3 stars are just for the nice staffs.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

My husband and I ordered the tasting menu with no drinks, totaling $230 SGD. The pacing of the food was off, the food was mediocre and cold, and the ambiance, loud and unpleasant.

The food: We ordered the babi buah keluak, the mum's curry chicken and the mix vege dish (includes egg plants, long beans, kang kong). Babi buah keluak was awesome, bitter and a little salty, not too sweet, a really good balance. The curry was cooked with generous about of coconut milk and was really creamy (i could eat the rice purely with the curry). The chicken was definitely fresher than usual. The vege was in my opinion normal.  The cost: Michelin star pricing for sure. 3 dishes with 2 brown rice came down to 93 dollars. Expected.  Overall: this is definitely a desire 3 to 4 stars.

Recommend: Eggplant with lemongrass, roasted coconut, and fresh cut chili...is a dry dish but goes terrific with a bit of rice, and the classic chendol .. the gula malaka is one of the best I have tried, sweet, but smooth and not over powering, almost like it's a fine brewed beverage and pandan on top.

1972,892,1,2021-06-16,"Food was good, not sure if it's necessarily worth the price tag though. That aside, service was absolutely horrendous. I have no idea how this has a Michelin star.  We visited Friday evening and the moment we sat down, we wanted to order the tasting menu. The older Asian male staff was extremely rude and snapped at my friend saying ""You can't order that"". Taken aback, she asked why. The staff said we wouldn't have enough time to finish it. We were confused as to why we wouldn't since we made a reservation and only then were we told that the dining slot we have is only for 1.5 hours. They claim to have called us days prior to inform us of this, but no calls were ever received. Even when we called the restaurant the day of, we never heard about this.  Nevertheless, we got the tasting menu and told the staff we'd just rush through it a bit. That being said, the male staff kept patrolling our table and reminding us  ""you have X amount of time left"". What on earth? Is this a Michelin star restaurant or a local Asian cafe where you get screamed at by an uncle...  We also had an encounter with two female staff at the front, who were equally as rude. The only redeeming quality of the entire fiasco was a server named Gerrybee (?). She was lovely and she was the only reason why we left the restaurant with a smile on our faces.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

The food is amazing, with every single dish having a flavor profile very different to what you find in other cuisines.

Nothing exquisite or memorable about the food for me to rave.  For the price I would expect the food to be like wow.. for both taste and look.

2208,1128,1,2020-06-16,"‚ÄúOnce in a lifetime experience‚Äù. Meaning don‚Äôt bother going back again after trying it once.  This restaurant is definitely more suited for tourists, expats, foreigners. For the local palette, the food you get at Candlenut will not be dissimilar to what you might get at a hawker centre or in a family home-cooked meal.  This could very well be the strategy that the restaurant is going for - a taste of home - and indeed with themes like ‚Äúah mah kase‚Äù for their Omakase menu, the whole set up is geared towards nostalgia which admittedly the restaurant does well enough.  But at S$128++ per pax (the omakase menu) for a home-cooked meal? It‚Äôs hardly worth it when you could probably get the same food by going to hawker centre or Peranakan restaurant (no need for michelin stars) for a fraction of the cost.  What was more astonishing and probably the nail in The Coffin for me is that the ah mah kase menu contains sunny side up eggs as one of the main dishes!! Yes I can understand having satay and kueh salat in there but sunny side up eggs?! Come on... candlenut team - u can do better than that. Eggs cooked on a frying pan garnished with exotic beans are hardly ‚ÄúPeranakan‚Äù food. Everyone and their Ah Mah can do it.  You need to rethink your strategy. Ah Mah will never charge S$128++ per pax for a meal. Things like sunny side up eggs should never be on a tasting menu befitting of a Michelin star restaurant.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

2210,1130,4,2020-06-16,"Most of the food served were delicious. However, from a subjective Peranakan (home fed by an excellent cook, my late mum & my aunts), Candlenut dishes are mostly Peranakan-inspired and a couple of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù ones. Authentic homecooked Peranakan cuisines, involve complex and laborious preparation, and are meticulously cooked. From texture, to micro-cuts, punchy aroma, spices and level of spicy-ness... all are specially prepared to the whims-and-fancy of family members. Hence, Peranakan diners are oft hard to please and make critical reviews. From this perspective, it‚Äôs more misses than hit.

We ordered few signature dishes but nothing stood out.  Overall dinner felt rushed and it was clear the servers were moving things along very quickly to clear the table.

This time, we managed to get a table for dinner and both my partner and I were really excited.  Allow me to summarise our overall experience at the end of it:  1) Service was excellent! Ambience was good, music was jazzy, went well with the food. (Pun intended)  2) The menu looked exciting as they offered two different sets of it. One for their original ""Omakase"" called Ah-Makase (Pun intended), the other, an ala-carte menu.  3) This is where it started to decline. We ordered what was recommended by one of their servers, roughly around 5 dishes in total. (Spoiler alert)  Out of the 5, the only one we enjoyed was the pork neck satay ($20). The other 4, consisting of blue crab curry ($28), Peranakan hokkien mee ($34), kuay pie tee ($20), crispy snapper fillet ($36) were honestly mediocre at best. *Not forgetting white rice.  So yes, we ended up paying close to $200 for 2 pax (Without dessert nor wine) and we didn't feel like it was worth the amount. Maybe we expected too much for the food? I don't know. But what I do know is that if you've never tried peranakan food, I would recommend you to dine here.  If you've had peranakan food before, you've extra time and a few extra hundreds to throw around. You can give it a try.",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

Our server, the elderly uncle, was very warm, witty and it really made a positive difference to our dining experience.  Having minor allergy to shellfish, I am generally not a crustacean eater and I try to stay away from squid, octopus and crabs in general. However, since Seafood was offered as part of the tasting menu, I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful these sea creatures tasted. I like the portion, variety and although it looked small at the beginning, both my wife and I left the restaurant feeling a tad bloated from clearing up every single item served to us.  As we visited the restaurant during our wedding anniversary, the team also treated us with a nicely presented dessert as a gift to us. Really thoughtful of them.  This is one restaurant well deserving their Michelin Star, and I am so proud to have them within reach in Singapore.

Today‚Äôs review is mainly on the dishes I ordered.  The Ngor Hiang is too dense and likely, it is prepared by machine instead of chopped minced.  The Wagyu Beef Rib Rendang is tenderly soft, fragrance and of flavor. And that‚Äôs is about the saving dish though is saltish but bearable.  The Chicken Buay Keluak is too saltish, I can‚Äôt taste the natural sweetness of the chicken. It is not balance.  The 4 Heavenly King vegetable is good but is also saltish.

During the main courses, the staff reminded us a few times to take rice together to balance all food to best flavour.  They shared very clear information of the menu, and were very friendly to a busket of questions from us.  Aside from food serving, staff here even proudly shared about peranakan culture, history.  I like the structure through the whole menu. E.g. the warm soup connecting the dry starters and strong main dishes; the main dishes served together feels like a home lunch - eating is more flexible and easy to share.

2314,1234,3,2019-06-17,"Candlenut is in a beautiful location in Como Dempsey. I'd heard many things about the restaurant and was curious to try it myself. My table ordered the ah-ma-kase which is a super cute local take on the tasting menus of fancy restaurants. Out came a flurry of dishes, all tiny and exquisite.  When it comes to Peranakan food, I'm used to sizable portions and strong flavors. Here it's a little more refined and didn't give me that satisfaction of endless amounts of food despite being satisfying overall. Shoutouts to the fish cracker starter that was airy and crunchy and delicious, the lamb satay which was mind blowingly tender and flavorful, the wing bean salad that was refreshing and crunchy, and the blue swimmer crab curry which was lemak and really good. I also liked my durian dessert though I guess if you have good durian you don't need to mess with it too much.  For the price I paid, I wanted more food. It was all nice but I'm a stickler for tradition and would probably go back to my old haunts for some good old Peranakan eats. This is somewhere I'd bring guests or have a fancy meal!",Candlenut - Dempsey Hill

There are a line of restaurants inside, and Candlenut did not particularly distinguish itself from the others in decor. The reception and wait staff were friendly and helpful, although you felt that they were delivering the description of the dish by rote and not with personal experience or deep knowledge. We like spicy food, but we thought the heat level was a notch too much to appreciate the fresh ingredients underneath.

I was expecting dishes to be more creative and surprising and although they were well executed, they didn't bring home any new tastes.  We were 4 people and all had the tasting menu. One thing that really put me down was the fact that they brought half of the courses, all at the same time, with the 4 portions combined into single bowls. This meant 3 things: 1) we ended up eating some of the dishes cold, instead of freshly made 2) we were left to split ourselves each portion into 4, trying to fish out all the different ingredients that should go into our plates, but this was not always possible, so we didn't experience the full combination of tastes 3) we were left to guess what would be the best order to eat the dishes.

2355,5,3,2024-06-09,"Came here for a quick dinner to celebrate my sister's birthday after her work. The food came out slowly and they forgot to serve 2 dishes, the chicken soup and duck pastry. When we asked the server for it, she said it has been served and that she cleared the plate. We told her it hasn't, but she insisted that it did. What a horrible and humiliating experience, to imply that we are liars who have already eaten the food. The restaurant print out your orders and puts it on your table. Each time the food is served, the servers will cross it out from the list. The duck pastry and chicken soup clearly was not crossed out, so why did she say it was already served? She said she cleared the table, and that she had taken the plate away. But when the duck pastry was finally served, IT CAME OUT ON A SMALL PLATE. THE PLATE SHE CLEARED WAS A LARGE PLATE THAT HAD VEGETABLES, NAIBAI ON IT. IT WAS CLEARLY A DIFFERENT PLATE.  I understand that it gets busy, but to insist that the food had already been served, and that FOUR of us already eaten it, when WE HAVEN'T is such a horrible experience. YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN EATING IT? All four of us? Please never do that again and imply that we are liars. The duck even came out on a SMALLER PLATE, different from everything we have had on the table. We never had such a small plate on the table and she never cleared such a small plate. AFTER 40 MINUTES OF WAITING, this is how we are treated. Horrible.  It really ruined our night, when we just wanted to celebrate a birthday. Food's great though.  EDIT: Gong Li came to apologise on our way out to pay, saying she thought she cleared an oval shaped plate with paper on it for the duck, when it was actually a small circle shaped plate with paper. Still humiliating for us and a terrible way to handle the situation. Changed the service rating from one star to three for the apology, but I still don't understand why she had to gaslight us into thinking it was already served, when it was not.",Din Tai Fung - Paragon

From the entrance it was clear that there were 3 big empty tables of 6 seats available, but I was asked to wait for an extra 20 mins before being seated. This approach is obviously not very customer oriented nor well thought out.  Next, service staff has no initiative. When serving food on to the already full dining table, the staff opted to clear 1 empty dish, leaving behind 3 other empty dishes. A few minutes later, another staff came and took away another empty dish.  When server wanted to serve up more dishes, he just kept squeezing the plate on to the already full table, when the obvious solution was to clear away the other 2 empty dish.  It is genuinely disappointing that the service staff in Paragon branch has no initiative, no common sense nor customer service. And I cannot genuinely recommend this branch to anyone else.

2626,276,5,2024-06-15,"Din Tai Fung is hands down one of the best lunch places I've ever been to! It's definitely my favorite spot to grab a bite to eat. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is outstanding.  One dish that is an absolute must-try is the fried rice. It's so flavorful and perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of seasoning and ingredients. And of course, the Xiao Long Baos are a must-order as well. These soup dumplings are some of the best I've ever had, with a juicy filling and a delicate, perfectly steamed wrapper.  While I absolutely love Din Tai Fung, I should mention that my husband doesn't always share my enthusiasm. He sometimes finds the portion sizes to be a bit too small for his liking, which can be a downside for those with a bigger appetite. However, I personally find the portion sizes to be just right, and I think that the quality of the food more than makes up for any concerns about portion size.  That being said, if you're someone who likes larger portions, it's worth keeping this in mind. However, I would still highly recommend giving Din Tai Fung a try, as the food is truly exceptional and the service is fantastic. It's definitely one of my favorite lunch spots, and I'm always eager to go back!",Din Tai Fung - Paragon

The food is good, but the downside is that it doesn't have the original taste and satisfaction. I haven‚Äôt been there in the past three years or so.

WORSE DIN TAI FUNG EVER,  TOLD THE MANAGER NOT SURE IF ANYTHING WILL BE DONE TO RETRAIN.  Here‚Äôs the full story:  I would like to let you guys know that Din Tai Fung's outlet, although it received Excellent Service award for 5 consecutive years, has dropped their service standards.  I was at Din Tai Fung Paragon and their waitress service was horrendous.  We were waiting patiently for her to serve us but all the waitress did was ignore us from the start. We waved to signal her we were ready and she just gestured to wait.  This was not once but all 5 times. Never have any Din Tai Fung outlet use such gestures to us, but would speak to us professionally to let us know that they will come back for us. For the first time in visiting Din Tai Fung for the past 7 years, there was such service.  The waitress never once showed any sincere service during our dining experience.  One of my dishes took about 20 minutes to arrive. So we had a slow start to the dinner. Within less than an hour, our plates were constantly cleared in a disturbing manner. On the one hour mark, the chinese waitress comes forward and with no good attitude, tells us that we have been hogging ÔºàÈú∏Âç†Ôºâ the table.  We were stunned. Not even once we were told that they required the table and informed us the dining limits as they could communicate with us, but they did not. They just chase us out.  I do believe that is not the Din Tai Fung standard and we made it clear to the person at the cashier that this service was horrendous, employee no 6001. Dine at 22 April 6.50pm on the right hand side of e restaurant when entered. Small eyed Chinese waitress with vest.",Din Tai Fung - Paragon

If you are there to pick up the food yourself, be sure to ask the staff about your order.  The staff will bring out delivery orders for the food delivery companies such as Grab but don‚Äôt tend to for those placed directly by the customers.  If you are outside, you will see the staff calling out order numbers to the delivery men/women.  They unfortunately don‚Äôt tend to do the same for customer orders.

Ok, it is a chain and it is very fast pace with a quite unfriendly (but efficient) staff, but the food is very nice for the quality.  Their Cha Long Bao are simply the best thanks to their very thin paste and tasty juice.  I brought my parents there when they came visit me and they cale back at least 3 Times during their short stay in Singapore!  I recommand their chili oil wantons (amazing) and their pork Cha Long Bao of course. You can take their Jasmin tea which comes with unlimited refills and of good quality (do not expect too much from it, as it is not gong fu cha haha)",Din Tai Fung - Paragon

We were seated by a friendly waitress who immediately noticed it was our first time in the restaurant. She was extremely helpful explaining the menu, helping us order, and even giving us some useful tips for mixing the ginger, soy vinegar dipping sauce for the Xiao Long Bao dumplings.  We ordered the drunken chicken , XLB dumplings, house special wontons, shrimp rice, veggies, and fried pork soup. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. The house special wonton in spicy sauce was the standout dish. The pork soup was also excellent- very flavoursome and the meat was lean and tender. We paid $81 for the two of us which we thought was great value. The place was ranked one of the top 10 restaurants in the world (in 1993) by the NYTimes...its still up there I guess.

We ordered xiao long bao, fried noodles, dumplings, chicken soup, and fried rice. Although they are not large in quantity, they all have a gentle taste and are suitable for everyone. The downside is the price...I was so surprised when I tried to order salted cucumbers that I had to cancel.

3573,103,2,2024-03-17,"Let me tell you about my experience at Liao Fan Hawker Chan in Singapore's Chinatown. Now, I'm not gonna lie, the wait was a bit of a doozy. There's always a line snaking out of this place, and for good reason apparently ‚Äì it's a Michelin-starred hawker stall! But hey, perseverance is key, right?  Finally, I snagged a seat and ordered their famous soya sauce chicken rice. Let me tell you, the hype was real. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender, perfectly flavored with this savory, sweet soy sauce. It wasn't greasy at all, and the rice soaked up all those delicious juices. It was simple, but absolutely delicious.  Now, it's definitely not fancy. It's a hawker stall after all ‚Äì plastic tables, open-air seating. But that's part of the charm, right? You get this real, authentic Singaporean experience, all for a super affordable price.  Overall, I'd highly recommend Liao Fan Hawker Chan, especially if you're a foodie on a budget. Just be prepared to wait a bit, but trust me, that chicken rice is worth it!",Hawker Chan - Chinatown

I told them about it and they rudely told me that there are 4 pieces of meat and that you get what you get. But of course a breast cut into 4 pieces is not the same as a wing, which is what I got.

The restaurant had ample seating available, as most patrons appeared to be dining on-the-go. The food was quite good, and while there wasn‚Äôt much service to speak of, the self-serve model made ordering and picking up our food a breeze.  The restaurant‚Äôs decor was minimalistic, with a few Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The walls were adorned with pictures of the restaurant‚Äôs founder, Chef Chan Hong Meng, who was awarded a Michelin star for his signature dish, the soy sauce chicken rice1. The restaurant‚Äôs ambiance was casual and laid-back, with a mix of locals and tourists enjoying their meals.  We ordered the soy sauce chicken rice, which was the star of the show. The chicken was tender and juicy, with a crispy skin that was bursting with flavor. The rice was cooked to perfection, with a fragrant aroma that complemented the chicken perfectly. We also tried the char siew rice, which was equally delicious. The char siew was succulent and sweet, with a smoky flavor that was simply divine.  The restaurant‚Äôs prices were reasonable, with most dishes priced under $10. The portions were generous, and we left feeling satisfied and content.

Then I ate it. The chicken was cold and half of it was bones. The taste was decent but my chicken guy at home easily beats that without effort. The rice tasted like rice and the sauce wasn't proportional to the amount of rice. Therefore I mostly ate dry rice with cold chicken. The fried dumplings tasted very good, but that isn't the end of the story.  After I ate there my stomach was feeling a little funny. I mostly ignored it and the feeling went away. In the evening around 1 am my whole belly began to hurt. First I thought it was just a little bit of air but after I massaged myself a little I knew it was something else. I don't want to tell you anymore details about my night and I am quite certain you dont want to hear it.  Anyways don't go there, it's worse than any restaurant and doesn't deserve a Michelin-anything. And I really mean it.

The staff is very unpleasant, annoyed by the customers. The tables are poorly cleaned. BE CAREFUL, never before seen, there are no towels!!!! The height‚Ä¶ The toilets are very dirty. This restaurant should be closed for hygiene reasons. It's serious. You'd think you were at McDonald's, you queue, you pay and you wait for your number to appear on a screen to get your dish.

After ordering, less than three minutes after you sit down, he comes over and tells you that there are 12 minutes left for the meal... and then it's not eight o'clock. Turn off the air conditioner when you arrive. Very poor service! If the food is delicious, forget about the poor service attitude, but it turns out to be super unpalatable; in addition to the fried chicken, which has some good reviews, the barbecued pork actually has a pig smell, the braised duck is not much different from chai, and the roasted pork belly The meat... was not crispy at all, and the braised egg had no taste at all. Apart from the slight color on the surface, it was no different from a boiled egg! I originally thought that the recommendation of one Michelin star would satisfy me, but I didn‚Äôt know it would be so unpalatable!

I ordered a soy sauce chicken and a roast pork rice. The soy sauce chicken is quite tender and the soy sauce tastes sweet, not salty at all, so it's no problem to eat it on an empty stomach. It's a great value to have such quality at this price. (But as a Guangzhou native who has been eating chicken since childhood, this is normal and not as amazing as the rumors say.) As for the roast pork, it was more average. The skin was thin, but not crispy, and a bit hard. But having said that, this place is really cost-effective, the total of the two items is less than 20 Singapore dollars. Coupled with the Michelin aura, it‚Äôs not a bad idea to have a meal here. What's also interesting is that the chef here (the man in the promotional photo) is actually maintaining order outside the door, and the girl who is ordering inside shouts to the chef, ""Why don't you let people in?"" ü§£ In addition to the fact that Mother's Day was approaching, the chef also gave a bowl of sugar water to every lady dining in the restaurant.

For $6.80, i can have nicer chicken at the nearby Chiew Kee soy sauce chicken and need not be subjected to bad attitude and service and cold food.

No smile, no thanking me for my payment.  Secondly, the size of my order was supposedly for sharing. If that was the case there would still be 2 hungry people.  Thirdly, the food wasn't even hot. Some of the meat was warm but some were still cold. Some of the pieces were hard and dry, and much too salty.  Finally, after sitting down after just 10 mins I was told the shop was closing. This was just after 7:30pm. I explained I wasn't even close to finishing yet so they decided to clean around me. It was clear they wanted me out. I rushed what I could and left.

And $6.80 is still $1 cheaper than ice drip... Go figure  Whoever think this deserve Michelin star is probably Ang moh. Our chinese ancestors will probably be putting their legs down from their grave if they found out that this dish was iconic dish in our country for a few year running. I can only imagine how bad the rice dishes in their country are.  Meaty part of chicken wing was tough but as I get lower I can sort of see glimpse of why Ang moh think this is tasty. Other saving grace was the chili, lime was probably squeezed into it. It is better than the usual I would say. Probably close to those they gave for oyster lwa.  Well should have stayed non air con and kept the price lower. Bad marketing in my point of view trying to milk the goose. When it is hawker food it is competing with expectation of cheap food. Now with all air con, it is competing with other air con eatery.  It failed against hawker food not just in term of price but taste as well. Against well fast food the taste is not as good.

My husband loved it this spot so much that we came here twice during our trip. In fact, it was actually our first and last meal in Singapore. I thought it was good but Michelin star good? I'm not sure about that. The first time we came, we went with the classic soya sauce chicken. The chicken was tender and flavorful and I loved the chili sauce on the side. But, it's pretty reminiscent of the soy sauce chicken rice spots back home in NYC's Chinatown. The food is cheap compared to NYC prices but expensive when you compare it to hawkers of similar quality. It's that Michelin star and the store front that allows them to price up, and people (like me) will pay that premium. The second time, I got the same thing but hubby added the pork belly and cha siu. The pork belly was good but the cha siu was mostly fat. There wasn't a line either time but the second time, we did have to wait a bit for our food to come out.

However, the lack of warmth and inconsiderate service was a bit disappointing. For example: 8 adults were only given two trash cans. , the utensils for opening crabs were only given to one serving, and it was suspected that they were collected by mistake on the way so that the whole table could not find them. During the meal, the waiter used tongs to pick up the crab shells from time to time without saying a word. The dining atmosphere was somewhat unpleasant because of his service. Comfortable, you can use it until 7:00 for two hours of dining, but at 6:20, the waiter in the private room silently took away other people's plates, chopsticks, knives and forks, etc. without confirming with us whether we still need to use it. He only got lemonade to wash his hands outside, and there was no explanation why there was no lemonade. Later, the male clerk who originally ordered the food explained to us that he hoped Jumbo could do a good job in employee training or personnel allocation.  The chilli crab is sweet and spicy, but it may be too spicy for people who don‚Äôt eat spicy food. Travelers with children or those who don‚Äôt eat spicy food are recommended to order the salted egg crab. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you order it a little longer. The Malay fried noodles are also slightly spicy but good. Eat, the fried rice is also good, the oatmeal shrimp balls are sweet and fragrant, the taste is a bit like mayonnaise shrimp balls, but the texture is crispy.

5073,493,4,2024-02-16,"It's a taste I don't really like or dislike. It's salty, so it's better to eat it with rice or buns. My personal preference is that if you don't like seasoned chicken, you'll probably like it less (?) in a similar way. Still, it's cheaper than eating it domestically, so I think it's a good idea to try it at least once when you travel. Two women came out with crab + bun + rice + cereal shrimp + cola for 180 pounds. It was a lot, so we only ate one cereal shrimp and wrapped it all up to eat the next day (it was still delicious the next day). The food overall wasn't bad, but the restaurant... I have no idea about the interior since I didn't go inside, and the outdoor seating area was very messy. There are a lot of groups of guests so it feels noisy and hectic. I think it would be okay to eat and drink with a group of people, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want to eat quietly.",Jumbo Seafood - Riverside Point

5091,511,4,2024-02-16,"If you want to eat chilli crab in Singapore, do it here! Ô∏è Before going out to eat during the Great Singapore Sale, be sure to make reservations through JCB to save money. 15% cheaper. There are 3 stores, but I think the taste is the same in all of them. I've been there many times, but this time I used it for lunch. The store opens from 12:00, but registration is accepted from before that time, so it would be a good idea to register early. I was 5th in line on a Monday, 15 minutes before they opened at 12pm. It was raining and humid, so we ate inside the restaurant where it was cool. When I finished eating all the food, the locals at the table next to me taught me a lot of things. They said it would be better to stop using the set because it was a waste and it was expensive. It would be cheaper overall if you choose what you want to eat, that's right. Locals don't order set menus and don't use credit card discounts. If you look closely, you'll see that it has a special price of $130, but it seems that the price is slightly higher than the original price. Special price $130 no matter which store you go to. It seems that the price will be set at exactly 10,000 yen in Japanese yen. I learned from the locals how to try different foods. There are 3 stores, and I think this store is the best place to eat while looking at the river, and East Coast is the best place to eat while looking at the ocean. East Coast has the largest number of stores.  Please try using it.",Jumbo Seafood - Riverside Point

When I entered the restaurant with a reservation at 5pm, the terrace seats were empty, but the restaurant was almost full. Looking at the menu with photos, I ordered chili crab, stir-fried water spinach, fried rice, something similar to yakisoba, and something a little sweet like fried bread that the hotel concierge had recommended. The stir-fried water spinach that arrived first had a slightly spicy seasoning with garlic! This is great with beer! The famous chili crab is probably the best way to eat crab. It tastes so good that you can't believe it! It was so delicious! The fried rice was crispy and the yakisoba was quite spicy but delicious! The taste was very satisfying, but due to the price, it cost about 35,000 yen for 4 people. ^^; However, it was delicious and a great memory, so I'm glad I went!

5537,7,5,2024-06-15,"CHEF JO IS AMAZING!!! We had a wonderful, cozy dinner to celebrate a friend moving out of Singapore. We sat by the bar seats, right in front of the cooktop and Chef Jo and crew prepping, from burnt cabbages to sliced carabinero. The food was amazing, creative and refreshing but nothing so overdone the taste of the ingredients is lost. We wrote in to get the tasting menu even though it was not the weekend, and it was the perfect choice. The minced pork head served on a twig (with half a pig skull!) was unique and a nod to Philippine sisig, the country's famous bar chow. The wagyu beef tart had a unique twist with shaved salted egg yolk on top. The avocado and eel consomme was a wonderful blend, with the natural taste of the eel brought out. I enjoyed how it was the same with the sawara fish and scallop mousseline, the natural seafood taste remained front and center and highlighted by the dish. This peaked with our favorite dish for the night--the carabinero where we dipped into the shell for all the natural juices to compliment the prawn meat, it was divine. The wagyu beef tongue had the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The desserts were also a wonderful blend of natural tastes, with a refreshing sorbet with grapes and a rich milk ice cream with bee pollen. The third and final dessert course that started with a macaroon was a wonderful ending. My only regret is we visited on a Monday and not a Friday night so we skipped the wine pairings, definitely a good reason to come back. We really enjoyed how it was Chef Jo herself in front of everyone at the counter, introducing each dish and coming out for selfies. It was the perfect personal touch for such an intimate venue.  FYI the reviews complaining about the venue/ambience/noise/lack of space miss the point that Lolla is famous for being a heritage shophouse, a small conservation property, since it opened in 2012. These are like complaining about a Japanese restaurant because you hate sushi.",Lolla
5538,8,5,2024-06-15,"This was a meal a long time coming. We honestly wanted to try it as we saw both restaurant and chef making waves. When we checked the website, the menu - particularly the seasonal one - looked most interesting.  I read previous reviews that were unhappy about the bar counter seating. Maybe it's because I'm not a big person but it didn't bother me one bit. As a matter of fact, I appreciated the casual atmosphere of Lolla. Everybody was very warm and welcoming.  Enjoyed the meal very much. So much so that I'm just waiting for my next SG dates to confirm and I will be sure to reserve again. Calling out the burnt cabbage which packed quite the flavor while retaining all the ""cabbagey-ness"" and the crab relleno which was nuanced but did not miss a beat on the unctuousness you would expect from crab and aligue.  Was it expensive? Yes. But not beyond what you would expect from a restaurant of that caliber in Singapore.  Very happy to have had this meal and looking forward to it again.",Lolla
5539,9,5,2024-06-15,Finished every dish down to the last bite.,Lolla
5540,10,4,2024-06-15,"Good overall. The hand torn pasta with brown crab stood out in taste and texture. Although dishes were creative (some familiar), it didn‚Äôt make an impact to be memorable. On the other hand, service was great.",Lolla
5541,11,3,2024-06-15,"Food was average at best. we were sat downstairs and service was extremely slow - we had to chase them multiple times. Not sure what the hype is about, didnt meet expectations for a top 50 in asia",Lolla

Non-alcoholic drink - Limonata (Made in Italy lemonade)  One of us ordered additional squid ink pasta (Uni fideaua).  In fact with the help of sourdough, 4 course is just nice for lunch.  No complaint on any of the dish.  Like the savoury taste of the kombu when it was spread on the sourdough.  Have finished the last drop of the aligue sauce with the remaining sourdough.  The mixture of the caviar and sesame oil with the hay ice cream was a surprising combination.",Lolla
5548,18,5,2024-04-16,"Hands down, Lolla is on my list of TOP 3 restaurants in Singapore. Service is impeccable. A few favourites: sea urchin pudding, pan fried lemon sole with crispy capers, mayura wagyu tri-tip,burnt cabbage with crispy capers. And if you are a fan of cheesecake, you MUST definitely get Lolla‚Äôs burnt cheesecake! You won‚Äôt regret it, trust me. I am not living in Singapore now but I am still dreaming of the food there. My prediction: Lolla is on Asia‚Äôs 50 best restaurants 2024. TOP 50 this year.  Update on 26th March 2024: My prediction came true! No.43 on the list of Asia‚Äôs 50 Best restaurants 2024.

Portion size is slightly small but the taste and flavours were supreme and suited me. Big love for the tuna tartare, sour dough with kombu butter, iberico and lamb chops  Edit: I‚Äôve been back a few times and the food has still been excellent each time.",Lolla
5551,21,2,2024-04-16,"Went here for Valentine's Day with my wife and I unfortunately did not have the best time.  I completely understand why Lolla doesn't have a Michelin star. They are almost good enough in every category but fall flat in all of them. The food is hit and miss, the service could use polishing, the ambiance could be slightly improved.  The Good:  - Food was prepared with skill and presented well. - The restaurant felt lively and romantic. - My partner liked the sea urchin pudding. They said it was unlike anything they ever tasted. - Everything tasted ok. Nothing was too memorable.  The Not-So-Good:  The decor was ok, I was seated in the basement of the restaurant where they have one really long table shared by multiple parties. To give people privacy they put a large amount of items all over the table and on the ceiling to create partitions. I appreciate the effort but it ended up making the table extremely cluttered and it was a tad difficult for me to see my partner at times.  If you're going to have a communal table lean into the concept and make it truly communal. This felt like they wanted privacy and a communal table but ended up getting a mediocre version of both.  The Bad: - The portion to price ration was extremely small. In one of my pictures you can see the iberico ham. Those 6-10 thin shavings were more than I've ever paid for iberico ham. Not to mention they were stuck to this rock and it was difficult to remove them. I'm sure someone thought it will look modern if they stick it on a rock but ultimately I want to eat my food not struggle to scrape it off.  - The communal table has a bathroom located behind the middle of the table. It's not great for obvious reasons.  - The most egregious offender was the service. The lady waiter was extremely rude and unprofessional. I was told I had 2 hours to sit, ok I get it it's Valentine's Day, but this lady would not leave me and my partner alone. She kept coming to us every minute asking if we wanted anything. It's like she read a book called ""How to be a waiter at a nice restaurant"" and saw a chapter called ""Be attentive"" and she just took it too far. I felt like I was at a bazaar getting harassed to buy something NOW when all I wanted to do was talk to my partner and bask in their glow and the romance of the day.",Lolla
5552,22,4,2024-04-16,"The restaurant serves modern Mediterranean cuisine. We ordered grilled octopus dish, burrata, grilled iberico pork, sourdough, grilled potato and cabbage. We would recommend octopus, burrata and sourdough which came with delicious aromatic butter. Burnt cheesecake was good too. There are only bar seatings on the first floor and a large table on the underground. Good for dining with friends.",Lolla
5553,23,4,2024-03-17,"It's a popular restaurant, so it's best to make a reservation early. There were 4 of us this time, so we were seated in the basement, but it was a nice atmosphere that was different from the first floor. The staff was friendly and the food was great.Maybe because of my age, I only left the Iberico because it was too greasy. Excuse me",Lolla
5554,24,5,2024-03-17,"Lolla offers an exquisite tasting menu that caters predominantly to seafood lovers. The option to choose between crab or uni as one of the main dishes is a delightful dilemma, highlighting the quality and variety on offer.  Each dish we tried was nothing short of delectable, demonstrating a high standard of culinary expertise and fresh ingredients. The flavors were well-balanced, showcasing a sophisticated approach to seafood that‚Äôs both innovative and deeply satisfying.  The service at Lolla was exceptional. The staff were not only friendly but also knowledgeable, making them great conversationalists and guides through the tasting menu.

The open kitchen format provided a nice touch in the atmosphere as well. We tried a selection of plates. Each was crafted in front of you and each plate was delicious. Difficult to find a fault in the plates apart from nickpicking small defects which are subjective. Decent wine list, but not great option for non alcohol drinkers.

It‚Äôs such a lovely restaurant, with amazing staff who are welcoming, friendly, helpful - such a delight. The cocktails were a delight, as were the wines by the glass.  The toasted bread and unique butter to start set the tone of excellence, followed by a flavorful tomato and home made ricotta salad. We chose the chargrilled octopus, duck fat potatoes, and Iberico ham. All were sensational.  We sat at the bar for dinner, and watched the kitchen staff at work.

5586,56,5,2023-09-19,"""The overall quality of the dishes is quite good, especially the lamb chops, which are extremely tender and worth a try! As for the duck fat potatoes, I suggest the chef could try using high-altitude potatoes. These have a higher starch content, which would make them smoother. Instead of boiling or deep frying the potato chunks, they could be slowly pan-fried or roasted for a crispy outside and soft inside. If they could be served with a plate of mountain pepper garlic mash oil chili, that would be even better!""",Lolla
5587,57,5,2023-08-20,"Update: I made a second visit and I could experience true lolla with excellent service and amazing food.  My friend really liked sea urchin. I thought all we tried were creative and tasteful. Tomato in burrata was sweet, the miso butter with sourdough has umami I love- runny burnt cake was beautiful.  I appreciate the team took my feedback sincerely and addressed it- albeit it could be trivial and they could have totally ignored it.  Thank you Wandi and team for the great dinner!  =============  Food is over priced, interior is not so tasteful. Staff were kind enough.

5611,81,5,2024-06-15,"We came to Lolla for their tasting menu.  We sat along the bench area where the real kitchen happened, so we could see everything that went on.  What stood out is the hard work that every staff put into the evening to make it enjoyable for the customers - from those creating the dishes in the kitchen to the servers who had to deliver all the dishes to the table concurrently whilst juggling the orders and demand from other tables.  Those in the kitchen worked together seamlessly, manoeuvring around a fairly tight space. Although undoubtedly hard work, yet the Chef and the team maintained a smile and entertained our questions and comments and making sure each table had their attention.  We are not small eaters, and we left the restaurant with a very full belly.  It was a full-on 2.5 hours of eating the Tasting menu.  The tasting menu is seafood based, and the overall quality of food is high, and the dishes were executed with finesse.  Most dishes were very well done, the flavours were there and presentations quite pretty.  A couple of the tasting dishes were less memorable (to me) but I'd put those down to personal preferences only.  Hats off to the Chef and her team.",Lolla

The uni pudding was a huge burst of flavour but was probably too cloying to enjoy and consume even half a pot on its own, it will be better if it was served with some bread/biscuit as a set to balance it out. We ordered the sourdough separately.  If we had to recommend, we would suggest getting the pasta and iberico pork.

5636,106,5,2024-06-15,One of the best experiences so far this year. Every bite is full of surprise. Definitely will come back every time I visit Singapore.  The entire menu was wonderful and delicious. The wine selection is also excellent.,Lolla
5637,107,5,2024-06-15,Small but well thought out menu. Best to order a lot of different things and share them all. Sit at the bar to watch the chefs at work. Very high energy but fun. Service was top notch. Good wine list as well.,Lolla
5638,108,5,2024-06-15,LOVE the new Lolla under Joanne. Seasonal menu keeps things interesting!,Lolla
5639,109,5,2024-06-15,Excellent tasting menu. The avocado with smoked eel is delicious. Sitting on the counter gives one a good view of the chef at work‚Äîa great experience. The menu changes seasonally.,Lolla

5642,112,4,2024-06-15,"Almost reaching our half a century mark in life, the miser in me somehow experienced a conversion in my gut that is transformative enough to convince me to shell out on a ‚Äòdegustation‚Äô dinner treat for my beloved partner on her special day. It was my first degustation dinner experience, so I was as gastrointestinally excited as I was mindfully disconcerted about the cost. To make myself feel better, I requested for a half wine pairing for the dinner that comes with 4 glasses of wine each, which does assuage my spending anxiety to enjoy the food more. To begin my review, I would like to comment on the physical set up of the restaurant, which is not what I would expect of a fine-dining restaurant. The chairs are stools with backrest and not cushioned, so it is rather uncomfortable. The table we were placed at was a long communal table, although we did get our privacy being placed at 1 end of the table away from other diners. We were seated underground, which has a dungeon-like ambience. So, if like me, you have a narrow mindset on furniture comfort in restaurants that charge a premium price, you might not be impressed. The first 3 dishes in this degustation menu are not outstanding to me. They are flavourful, but not exclusive and I feel like I have eaten something like that somewhere else before. Nothing is really new under the sun of course, yet I was still disappointed because I came with high expectation. Thankfully, from the 4th dish onward, the Makan experience really turned a corner. Every single dish from the Avocado dish onward was a delightful palate discovery for me. The assembly of these dishes helped to unpack the taste and texture of the ingredients for my taste bud in a way that differentiated tasting from eating, which I think is what degustation is about? I do not have the vocab to describe each dish, so I am just going to compliment dish 4 onward collectively as a delectable culinary riot that I was glad to be part of. Attached are some pics for reference. The wine selection was good, but I may be biased since I like drinking, with or without food pairing. I would like to thank this Chinese staff by the name of Yuki who did her best to host us and made the dining experience such a pleasant one. The restaurant was also very kind to gift us a very yummy burnt cheese cake for the birthday celebration, so thank you Team Lolla. Overall, it was a good dinner that we had, but comes with a cost that may inhibit me from returning, considering that there are so many other options in this price bracket. I would give a 3.5 to 4 rating for the restaurant in general. Not easy to run an F&B venture, kudos to the hard work and all the best to Lolla!",Lolla
5643,113,4,2024-06-15,Good food and service overall except for the donuts. The frying oil was not very fresh.,Lolla
5644,114,5,2024-06-15,Had an amazing dinner here! The wagyu and the cabbage and the olives were all insane. Restaurant is very cute too with most of the tables facing the kitchen which I personally love bc you get to watch the food as it is prepared. I think there are more tables in the basement as well. They do use a lot of butter but I love butter so that was just fine for me. Would definitely eat here again on another trip go Singapore!,Lolla
5645,115,4,2024-06-15,"Every dish was good. Burnt cabbage with crispy capers was interesting. My first time taking capers this way. Hand torn pasta was a decent plate and full of umami. Intense flavours from the Zucchini Blossom, Scallop Mousseline, Oscietra Caviar. The lamb shoulder was very good and the puree that came with it was smokey and was a nice complement to the meat.  Four stars as the sequence of the dishes served was a little off for us.",Lolla

5649,119,3,2024-06-15,"Celebrated friends' birthday at Lolla with their tasting menu and was underwhelmed by the amount served as well as the pace of the serving. The items are delicate and flavorful but when each item is a small bite and the next one is another 15-20 min wait it makes one crave for more. From the price POV, when I have 300SGD per pax after wines and still crave for some savory supper after that it seems I have left the place pretty unsatisfied. Would avoid the tasting menu in future and perhaps go for their ala carte.",Lolla

5661,131,5,2024-06-15,"Perfect to come for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Zero crowd and full attention! Chatted with some of the kitchen members and great insights about their dishes. Perfect birthday lunch treat by the missus!  What we ordered: - Seasonal flat bread was very very good! Herbaceous over a crispy flatbread. It had blue cheese in the pesto and elevated the dish entirely! - Sourdoug with kombu butter was also super yums! Must try and leftover bread can be used to mop up the other dishes! - Burrata was super yummy and fresh too! It‚Äôs great but this can be found at other restaurants. - Octopus was done almost perfectly. Had a bit of membrane but wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker. In face, it‚Äôs one of the better octopus dishes I‚Äôve tried. Finally a mash pur√©e that goes well with octopus leg! - Burnt cabbage. Prepared with lots of love and took at least 15 mins to get it cooked. Charred the outside and smothered in kombu butter‚Ä¶ carefully inside too! Steamed it on a pan and finished off with crispy capers and some feta I think. MUST TRY! It‚Äôs not a dish you can find anywhere else. - Burnt cheesecake another MUST TRY! They use some kind of Italian cheese with a bit of savory smokiness to the cake. Think gooey Gorgonzola cheese vibes in the center of the cheesecake. So bloody good and nothing like that before! - Doughnut balls were also light and fluffy. Very nice as the lemon curd. But if I had to choose, save space for the burnt cheesecake!  Service was also friendly and wine options are decently priced.  Probably about 300 in total for two with a bottle of white.  I‚Äôd be back with friends. Good place to hangout but I hear it‚Äôs very hard to get a spot during dinner. Limited seatings and tables.",Lolla
5662,132,5,2024-06-15,"Enjoyed all the dishes. Excellent quality and combination of ingredients, and cooking. Burnt cabbage with crispy capers ($22) - this was perhaps the most outstanding of the dishes with just the right combination of flavours and textures. Iberico secreto with braised cabbage ($42) - the secreto was tender and flavourful, the sauce was great, and so was the red cabbage. Pan-fried lemon sole ($55) - fresh, meaty, good texture, and went well with the crispy capers. Sea urchin pudding (full portion) ($65) - the uni was fresh, not mushy, and it went well with the pudding below. Sourdough with kombu butter ($12) - the bread and the butter were great. There were not just bar seats on the ground floor but also a huge table in the basement, that could be partitioned with large vases according to the size of the group.",Lolla
5663,133,5,2024-06-15,Went there for Mother's day celebration! Ordered lots of food and every single dish is incredibly good.  They also gave us complimentary dessert of Burnt Cheesecake!  Some key highlights. Burnt Cabbage: Don't let this simple dish name deceive you. The flavour is very complex and the chef really make this simple ingredient into a wonderful dish with depth in flavors.  Iberico Secreto Wow! It was tender and still retain some of the nice bite that iberico meat has. The flavour is well balance with a tinge of acidity that cut through the richness of this nice cut of meat! Wonderful.,Lolla

5668,138,4,2022-06-16,My friend and I went to Lolla without a reservation on a Wednesday night. They asked us to sit outside that's meant for smoking as they're fully booked but after much persuasion they found us 2 seats at the basement and by the time we finished and were leaving the restaurant was only half full. I always enjoyed the food at Lolla but it really annoys me to see some restaurants turn away guests when it was a walk in because it's instant revenue.,Lolla
5669,139,3,2022-06-16,"For the hefty price point, the chair is very uncomfortable and service was very slow. The famous uni pudding was tasty for one bite but got too rich afterward. My favorite was the lemon grilled fish. But the kale salad was blandest ever. The rest was not memorable ü•≤ ‚Ä¶",Lolla

5671,141,5,2022-06-16,"A friend and I had dinner and Lolla last weekend, and it was a fantastic meal! I dined here years ago for brunch and was wowed by the flavours then, so am glad I finally made it back for dinner. We ordered several dishes to share, and all of them were excellent, no complaints about anything. The ingredients were perfectly prepared and the flavours were standout. It would be hard to pick a favourite, the tomato and burrata salad was fresh and the flavours enhanced with the accompanying basil oil and white balsamic vinaigrette, and the sourdough toast was chewy and tangy. The crab pasta was cooked al dente with a rich, luscious sauce and generous hunks of crab, the octopus came with the creamiest smoked potato puree and had a great charred flavour, as did the iberico pork secreto, which was so tender and paired with a delicious sweet sauce, though not as tender as the wagyu beef tongue and cheek, which barely required chewing they were so perfectly cooked!  Dessert was a real highlight, I had the chocolate pistachio tart which was absolutely divine...rich dark chocolate, pistachio ganache and a crispy feuilletine base made for the perfect contrast of crunch and creaminess, and the accompanying pistachio ice cream really enhanced the nutty flavour. The wine was excellent too, I enjoyed the Auslese so much I had a second glass, and we both found the wine well priced and generously poured.  Service was great too, we were served by three different staff, two young ladies and a gentleman in a Hawaiian shirt, and all three were friendly, engaging and easily able to answer our questions about the menu and give recommendations and suggestions. The only downside is the seating wasn't the most comfortable, we were on high bar stools and also in a rather warm part of the restaurant, but it was fun to watch the food being prepared as we dined.  Yes, the food is pricey, and the portions could be considered small, but we both agreed the quality was worth the price and personally I love small portions as it means I can try more dishes. I will be visiting Lolla again, and not waiting so long to do so this time!",Lolla
5672,142,1,2022-06-16,"our first dinner on our trip to SG since the pandemic started & he was the only one who had the iberico pork. he had a really bad stomach ache the next day & for many days.. contacted the restaurant & not even a single apology was given but only said if you went to the doctors, we will compensate that fee for you. super disappointed & I don't recommend this place.",Lolla

5674,144,5,2022-06-16,Like the homey atmosphere of this cozy restaurant. Recommend the Kale and Cauliflower as  side dishes and the Fish with crispy capers. Try the sea urchin pudding but do it as a shared dish as the pudding may get a tad heavy.,Lolla

5687,157,4,2022-06-16,"When they first opened about 10 years ago, I visited @lollasg (home of the much-copied uni and squid ink custard pudding) quite a few times. Then a slew of restaurant openings proved a huge distraction for me over a long stretch but lately, after seeing my foodie friend @safarislim keep sharing about his meals there, my curiosity about the current Head Chef @johanne_siy‚Äôs produce-driven Modern European style of cooking was piqued. So it didn‚Äôt take a hot minute before Steven booked lunch for @szeliang888, himself and I. A recipient of 2021‚Äôs ‚ÄúChef of the Year‚Äù award by the prestigious @worldgourmetaward (WGA), Chef Jo‚Äôs initial plan of a part-time gig at Lolla turned into something more permanent as Covid intervened. Lucky for us in Singapore, I say! This lovely lady who left the corporate world a decade ago to follow her passion (it took her to renowned restaurants in different countries such as Caf√© Boulud and Le Bernardin with Chef Eric Ripert in New York as well as Restaurant Andr√© in Singapore), puts out some brilliantly executed dishes with unerringly delicious flavours. All of her original creations are available in Lolla‚Äôs Seasonal Menu - either a la carte or in a Tasting format, alongside their regular one. We opted for the $195++ 9-course Tasting route (they do a 7-course for $158++ as well) and this is how it unfolded: 1. Spanner Crab, Spent Kombu, Alique (Crab Roe) - A big and unapologetically moreish opener that was umami meets bright. 2. Oyster - Tastiness: 100%. One of the standouts from the meal for me, it was charred before being accessorised with a foam of its own juices, cabbage and seaweed vinaigrette. 3. Squid ‚ÄúLinguine‚Äù, Beech Mushrooms, Beef-Chorizo Bouillon - While the ribbons of squid were delightfully springy, it was the fragrant house-fermented black garlic-enhanced broth and the acidity from the pickled mushrooms that made the dish beautifully complex. 4. Hokkaido Scallop, Bouchot Mussels, Smoked Celeriac - A sublime symphony of seafood on fragrant celeriac pur√©e and prawn broth. The pickles and sea fennel were well chosen complements. 5. Porcini, Mandilli di Seta, Mushroom Fricassee - Loved the contrast between the minimalist look and maximalist flavours of this unique take on mushroom pasta. The al dente sheet of pasta, velvety-rich mushroom sauce, clear broth and slices of raw mushrooms - they all came together gloriously. 6. Glazed Veal Sweetbread, Puffed Beef Tendon, Spiced Palm Vinegar - If you aren‚Äôt squeamish about eating exotic parts, here‚Äôs a tastily done thymus gland glazed in Espagnole sauce and served with a crunchy beef tendon puff dusted in vinegar powder, chilli and lime zest. 7. Toasted Sourdough ($8++), Housemade Kombu Butter ($12++) - Not that we had much appetite real estate by this point in the meal but two of us couldn‚Äôt resist digging in when bossman @thaddeusyeo appeared with these. 8. Koji-cured Quail, Egg Yolk Confit, Black Truffles - Cutlery was redundant when it came to this. I found the quail immensely satisfying as it was grilled to juicy and tender perfection. 9. Strawberry Granita - My eyes widened when I had this palate cleanser. It seemed like the essence of the fruit was intensified but yet, it was not too sweet. Wouldn‚Äôt have minded a big bowl. 10. Black Truffle Gateau, Truffle Tree Nuts, Black Truffles - @szeliang888‚Äôs pick of dessert which he kindly shared a bite with @safarislim and I. The three-nut pur√©e of chestnuts, macadamia and hazelnuts was really memorable. 11. Fallen Fruit - Steven and I selected this sweet and savoury wonder of a 3-month-vacuum-aged ‚ÄúBlack Apple‚Äù which we enjoyed with an addictive Roasted Miso Ice-cream and toffee sauce.",Lolla

Tried the ceviche and monkfish from their seasonal menu and both dishes were delicious. For citrus fans, the donuts with lemon curd is a great end to the day.  A little pricey overall but their service is impeccable and food is fantastic so always worth a visit!",Lolla

5730,200,5,2021-06-16,"A quaint restaurant selling Mediterranean cuisine on small plates with some underground seating space. The staff is friendly and attentive. Downside, mobile service is intermittent underground and we had a bit of issue connecting to the WiFi.  Toasted sourdough with Kombu Butter - This was crisp and tasted great, a must try for bread lovers. Its worth the calories.  Uni with squid ink pudding - it had an incredible rich taste. We ordered the half portion which the waitress explained just halves the portion of sea urchin but has the same amount of pudding. An acquired taste for some.  Tuna Belly 'Chutoro' Carpaccio with watermelon - A light refreshing taste with actual watermelon pieces and watermelon juice.  Iberico Secreto with glazed fennel - Sliced to serve, full of flavour in each bite. This cut of meat is the butcher's secret,  so much so that there's controvery on where exactly the secreto is cut from.  Eggs with chorizo sausage - eggs can't really go wrong but this was enjoyable.  Duck Confit house-made Gnocchi with dehydrated Enoki and shaved cheese - one of the best dishes of the meal, a lovely pasta that isn't too filling despite the number of ingredients.  Saut√©ed Kale - Star of the show, really enjoyed the Kale saut√©ed in kombu butter. Would have ordered another if my stomach allowed.  Burnt cheesecake - featured on Time-out, there's a strong burnt flavour. A rich and creamy taste that is a bit too much for one person, but shared well amongst the table.  Overall a very enjoyable meal that was on the pricier side  but definitely well worth the money spent.",Lolla

Do call ahead and request for the counter seats.  Most dishes are served ‚Äòtapas‚Äô style in minute portions to share, sample and taste. Probably one of the most highly recommend items at Lolla, is this Sea Urchin Pudding, The sea urchin and squid ink pudding combine for a strong creamy seafood punch, yet in a refreshing and innovative taste.

5739,209,1,2021-06-16,"I'll stick to facts.  1. I was charged $162 more for my bill, which I carelessly did not vet the bill before paying. Only when I found out about it after looking at my statement did I realize. Called the restaurant and they confirmed that I was overcharged as my 2 glasses of wine was charged as 2 bottles of wine instead. I had to go back to the restaurant the next day and they gave me the difference in cash after waiting there for 15 mins. Not much was done to make it up to me as the customer despite the rest of the grievances below that was brought up to management.  2. Booked dinner about 3 weeks before the date, indicated it was for a birthday, called ahead to request for a more private table and that something be done for the birthday celebration. Had a confirmation that the requests will be noted and not to worry they'll make it special. On the day itself, was given a corner counter table at the door and was told by the cashier / receptionist that this is my table and there are no others available in a very ""take it or leave it"" way.  3. The end of dinner, no birthday special was done despite being promised it would be done.  4. We ordered 3 glasses of red wine in total and all 3 glasses had significant amount of floating cork in it.  5. We ordered the grass fed rib eye done rare, it came tough and chewy.  The portions were small and frankly the restaurant felt very poorly run.  I highly recommend heading elsewhere especially if you are looking to book this place for a special occasion. I hardly ever write reviews for restaurants, but this experience was so utterly damning that I simply could not let it go.  I would give this 0 stars if the review system allowed it.",Lolla

Its uni pudding deserves all the buzz it gets - it‚Äôs seafood and umami heaven in a bowl. The uni, fresh and plump, are even better than some I‚Äôve tried authentic sushi-yas. We also had their famed bread with kombu butter, pasta with brown crab and eggs with chorizo. The pasta was al dente and held on to every drop of silky sauce.

We shared a half portion of uni pudding but couldn‚Äôt finish it - the consistency was just not to my liking, but that‚Äôs a personal preference issue. Taste of it was good. Grilled avocados were ok. But the rest were amazing. I could just eat the butter and sour dough as a main itself! The pasta was wonderfully ‚Äúcrabby‚Äù yet not overly fishy. The pork was tender with just the right amount of char and perfectly balanced with the sweet caramelised onion. Service was prompt and attentive yet not pretentious. I‚Äôll definitely be back!

Bincho-grilled oysters were served with king oyster mushroom in a warm buerre blanc (white wine butter sauce), with a drop of basil oil and an oyster leaf that balanced the subtle richness of the sauce and the dense sweetness of the oysters (source varies depending on season). So you know see why it's named as such, because there are three ""oysters"" here - grilled oysters, king oyster mushrooms, and oyster leaf.  There are also other  good dishes here as well.

The reason of it because first thing not much choices of seating arrangement given to us. Only left with bar counter and table sharing. So the resturant reserved the bar counter for us. Second, the cook was washing on its cooking utensils at the bar counter, and the water from the basin had splashed to us (the water definately had splashed to our foods and wine). I complained to the cook and he told me its only water without apologise to me. Its not cheap to dine there but received such standard of hospitality. I think its not worth it. No dinning privacy and inappropriate way of washing  utensils are not accepatable at this kind of price range.",Lolla

I looked over the menu and ordered three items 1: sea urchin pudding (half) The pudding itself was rich but not too flavorful and actually very much covers the uni taste 2: duck rillettes I think they made it already and then put it into the microwave because the container is very hot. Also because the meat is very dry and no flavor and I only ate one small piece of bread before I told them I didn‚Äôt want it (at least they took it off my bill) 3. Lamb rack Two small pieces of lamb that were well cooked but unevenly salted The price you pay is definitely not worth it.

The sea urchin pudding is very flavourful. In fact, so flavourful that you will start to feel jelat quite quickly. I'd recommend to share it. I do admit I wish their servings would be a little bigger, but then again, it WAS brunch. All in all I have no complaints. Great for the occasional visit.",Lolla

We went to the restaurant and it was 9:50 pm and they did not let us in because the kitchen was closed, when they have a schedule outside the restaurant that it said that they close at 10:30 pm, so disrespectful. If I could rate them no star would be perfect they do not deserve anything.",Lolla

5856,326,4,2019-06-17,Lolla is a small cosy place with bar seating. The food is western but unique and is made for sharing. But the menu is surprisingly pricey. I enjoyed the doughnut with lemon sauce desert. 4 stars means that I would not mind eating here again. 5 stars means that I would need to frequently revisit the joint.,Lolla

5861,331,4,2019-06-17,"Lolla is situated in a highly trafficked area in the city & frequented by the many Caucasians working & visiting this city state. The atmosphere in the restaurant is casual chic. Service staff are friendly & make the effort to introduce the menu & recommendations. I'll say their suggestions are spot on. Go with them if you're unsure what to order. If you like tapas, this would be the place for you. Quality is very good and each dish has its unique complexity of flavours. We had a total of 5 tapas for 3 of us. It makes for a very full meal as we are small eaters. They have an extensive selection of wines (old world & new), champagne, cocktails & liquor. What we ordered: Konbu butter with toast (not pictured) Baked avocado with pickled fennel NZ clams in white wine sauce Escalope of beef tongue Apple torte",Lolla

5863,333,5,2019-06-17,"Awesome tapas. A bit pricey but the portions are reasonable and the quality of the food is fantastic. Seating is pretty much all bar seating facing the kitchen, and it's fun to watch the staff do their thing. In addition to their regular menu they have a bevy of daily specials - on our visit, the gnocchi, and the broccolini with anchovies, really stood out. The lamb from the regular menu was excellent too. Finally they have a great selection of vegetarian options so there's something for everyone here.",Lolla
5864,334,3,2019-06-17,"We ordered around 9 different dishes since we were a group of 6, and shared everything. Each portion is generous. Loved their sourdough bread with flavored butter, and also the grilled avocado - those were the two best dishes on the menu. Other things we ordered include Iberico shoulder (was good), gnocchi (it was fried and did not taste like gnocchi at all), roast duck (too rare and chewy), duck fat fried potatoes (simple and good - hard to go wrong with fried potatoes!), Burrata with peaches and honeycomb (this was good too, but the amount of cheese could've been a little more), skeet (basically stingray - this was bleh) and hand torn pasta with crab meat (was OK, too little crab). Overall, the experience was OK.  They serve no dishes with chicken, so if you're don't like red meat or duck, or if you're vegetarian, there isn't much for you on this menu. They also serve no rum, though they do serve spirits. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was good.  The ambience was good, since we got a corner of the table (it's a long sharing table). Not sure how it would be if we had to sit in the middle. Also, if they run out of chairs, they give stools which are at least a few inches shorter, so whoever gets the stool will find the height of seating to be inconvenient, especially since rest of the group will be on higher seating.  The waiter came around 9:45 and told us last orders by 10 and that they will shut by 10:30. However, when we requested for dessert at 9:50, he said the kitchen is closed and that when he came at 9:45 it was actually for the last order. The communication could've been more clear.  All in all, it was an OK experience. I doubt I'll go back.",Lolla

6059,16,2,2024-04-16,"Used to be an excellent mod Korean restaurant but food quality and service has dropped significantly since last visit 6 mths ago. Fish was even slightly smelly when eaten on its own and was edible only with what tasted like a generic sweet sour Thai sauce. Service was good in parts but largely inconsistent - asked for help from one of the servers, only to be rudely redirected to wait for another server. Around 1700 between 4 pax, was a very average meal for the price.",Naeum restaurant
6060,17,3,2024-04-16,"To be very honest the overall experience was decent but I can‚Äôt give it 5 stars due to some misses here and there. Firstly, one would assume that lunch menu would be significantly cheaper than dinner menu but turns out, once you add their add on signature noodles ($38) it turns out to be more expensive than the dinner menu which is quite shocking‚Ä¶ I mean tbh I would‚Äôve preferred to add abit more to just eat their dinner instead for the price but was misled or well mistaken on my end and also I guess I should‚Äôve done more due diligence so to those thinking of going, here‚Äôs a heads up. Basically the lunch is at $188 and they have 2 dinner menus at $218 and $268 and if you think about it, wouldn‚Äôt you just add a little more to get their most signature menu for dinner with more dishes?  Secondly the dishes were cooked well and tasted good but it wasn‚Äôt great, it wasn‚Äôt elevated cooking as you would expect from a Michelin restaurant. I don‚Äôt want to name names but I‚Äôve eaten at 2 different Korean Michelin restaurants within the same price range in other countries and those were way beyond the level here. But this doesn‚Äôt take away the fact that the dishes tasted good here.  Thirdly, the service was good and nothing was wrong, everyone was very professional and I can‚Äôt complain about the service. I think that shocked me the most was the pricing for the quality and quantity of the food. We were served Australian beef instead of hanwoo beef but maybe it was because of other reasons and might not be because of cost? This I‚Äôm not too sure but I would assume at this pricing, I would at least be able to have a piece of Hanwoo beef and also to be fair, the beef was cooked very nicely and also one of the better beefs I‚Äôve tried in the fine dining scene but you know‚Ä¶ since it‚Äôs a Korean fine dining place I would think most customers would appreciate some Hanwoo beef on the menu.  Lastly, the drinks were exponentially marked up which again I guess that‚Äôs what you get for dining out but $88 for non alcoholic drinks is quite intense. I know lots of effort is needed to make a menu of non alcoholic drinks (I do make my own kombucha at home) but maybe they could have priced it more economically? Wine pairing wasn‚Äôt cheap too but well‚Ä¶ expected?  Overall I can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt good but it definitely didn‚Äôt give me the full michelin experience I would‚Äôve wanted and I left a little disappointed and the portions were really small‚Ä¶ the noodles at $38 a pop was way too expensive imho and would have appreciated bigger portions. I left 70-80% full which is very rare after a Michelin meal.  Anyways, we spent $250 SGD PER PERSON and I just wanted to be honest and these are just my general views and experience, no harm intended. As I mentioned, the taste of the food is definitely good but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll return to spend anymore of my money here unless I hear from a friend that they‚Äôve made significant improvements but looking at previous issues mentioned I doubt it‚Äôs anything important for them to take seriously if customers are still flowing in.",Naeum restaurant
6061,18,3,2024-04-16,"TL;DR  Despite the commendable service, it was the ambience that fell short of expectations for a premium dining experience, particularly considering prices potentially exceeding $1,000, which presents a challenge in justifying a return visit.  Full review-  Ambience:  Upon arrival, the open layout of the restaurant was unexpected, deviating from the anticipated intimate atmosphere characteristic of high-end dining establishments. The proximity of larger tables the could fit 4 or more led to a noisy environment, detracting from the overall dining experience.  Notably during my service, the noise level was such that the service staff had to speak louder to ensure I could hear their introductions of the dishes.  The absence of private rooms, if any, was conspicuous, leaving patrons without the option of a more secluded setting.  Food/drinks:  While the presentation of each dish was meticulous and visually appealing, some fell short in terms of flavour complexity. Notably, the fish dish lacked seasoning, resulting in a rather bland taste profile despite the accompanying sauce.  Service:  On a positive note, the service provided was exemplary, with staff demonstrating attentiveness and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.  Their willingness to accommodate dietary preferences and offer detailed explanations of each dish added to the overall dining experience, mitigating some of the shortcomings in other areas.  Would I return?  Given the disparity between the anticipated upscale ambience and the actual dining environment, coupled with the substantial financial investment required, I find myself hesitant to consider a return visit.",Naeum restaurant

Each dish, from the 'memilmyeon' with its perfect blend of buckwheat, scallop, and white kimchi to the 'wando jeonbok' that marries abalone, wagyu beef, and seaweed in a symphony of flavors, was a masterpiece. The 'nobchi', a delightful mix of turbot, sweet cabbage, and parsnip; 'mechuri' with quail, leek mandu, and black garlic; 'dubu kimchi', a house-made dubu paired with braised kimchi and sotbap; and finally the ‚Äòsagwa‚Äô dessert made from apple shiso fromage blanc - each course was an exploration into culinary excellence.

It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.  The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!  Overall, I had a fantastic experience at your restaurant and would highly recommend it to others.

6085,42,5,2023-11-18,"[Late review]  Visited in May 2023  A fantastic dining experience which you won‚Äôt typically find anywhere else in Singapore. ‚ÄòKorean fine dining‚Äô at its best. The Summer 2023 menu is titled ‚Äòfrontyard barbecue‚Äô which is inspired by the chef‚Äôs memories of outdoor barbecue experiences in Korea.  There were 2 menus to choose from - Classic and Signature. If I recall correctly, the Classic menu is 6 courses and the Signature menu is 9 courses. I would recommend people to try the Signature menu as it has some dishes like duckgalbi (a starting dish) and Hotteok (dessert) which are truly exquisite.  Every dish brought had a distinct & unique flavour. My favourites were: - Duckgalbi - Somyeon (noodle & pork belly). The best dish in my view - The Wagyu beef - Pork rice (another fantastic dish)  Among drinks, I decided against the wine or non-alcoholic pairing. Instead I just ordered a couple of a-la-carte non alcoholic drinks. I would recommend people to try out the Lemon & Ginger Chung Fizz which is really refreshing.  Service was very helpful and kind. The restaurant was kind to cater to my shellfish allergy.  A 200% recommendation for one and all.",Naeum restaurant

6089,46,5,2023-10-19,"I had an incredible experience at this newly awarded Michelin star Korean restaurant. They skillfully incorporated authentic Korean ingredients, adding a unique twist to classic dishes with a kimchi base, elevating the overall taste. Each dish was meticulously prepared to ensure freshness, texture, and layers of flavor, leaving my taste buds satisfied. The grilled burger-like meat, their signature dish, was incredibly appetizing, and the grilled scallop atop buckwheat noodles was delightful. Savoring the sashimi with a flavorful sauce was a unique treat, and the well-cooked sliced abalone had a distinctive leaf-like texture. One standout dish was the fried Turbot fish, perfectly complemented by a delicious sauce. The meal was expertly paired with a variety of wines, from champagne to different types of white wine, enhancing the dining experience.  I was truly amazed at how the chef transformed simple Korean dishes into exquisite cuisine. The grilled duck meat, paired with a special sauce, was a perfect match for the Bordeaux wine. The addition of a unique sauce made the dish incredibly delicious. The Korean Bibimbap was prepared uniquely, incorporating high-quality ingredients. Tofu was layered on rice with grilled pork neck, creating a slightly spicy kimchi soup that complemented the mixture perfectly. Pairing it with rice wine gave an authentic Korean dining experience. The dessert was exceptional, featuring delightful ice cream infused with truffle, topped with a leaf-shaped chocolate that became my favorite, despite my usual aversion to sweets. I savored every bit! The meal concluded with a special dessert liquor, and to our surprise, we were greeted by the master chef. The restaurant's humble decoration created a cozy, homey atmosphere, making our dining experience truly memorable.",Naeum restaurant
6090,47,4,2023-10-19,"Episode Hello Signature - $238  Would have given more of a 4.2 out of 5 stars. The food at Naeum was really good, but I feel like in order to get a full 5 for a fine dining experience, every dish must have been memorable. There were 2 to 3 dishes in the signature menu that I felt were more forgettable unfortunately. I'll name one: the cold buckwheat noodles with scallops.  Service was really good though, and the ambience of the place was nice and warm. The dishes that people at my table of 5 seemed to like most were the appetisers. A decent experience overall.",Naeum restaurant

Creative flavors with multiple layers, but we thought the dishes lacked finesse‚Äî overly sweet in many cases (at least for our taste) and thick sauces sometimes covered up the flavor of the ingredients. Separately, we ordered the half wine pairing (3 glasses) and did not feel that the wine and food complemented each other‚Äî it probably did not help that one of the wine was not the one listed on the pairing menu.

6098,55,2,2023-08-20,"Takes really long to get a booking at this place. Its very disappointing and failed to meet our expectations food-wise. The people they hired to wait tables and entertain guests are top notch. At this price point, the ambience is way too casual and noisy.  Would highly recommend it to people who like hype stuff with not much substance in terms of food. The best dishes are the add ons for the signature menu which makes me wonder whether I should have just gotten the add ons without the rest of the food. Not much of a backyard bbq (thats the theme this season). It is weird that they give you a drawer full of cutlery which you have to take for yourself and figure out what goes best with each dish.  Dish review: - The starters are nicely presented, tastes semi Korean? Not sure. Didn't get any signals that ""this is Korean"" nor ""this is absolutely delicious""  - *addon* duck galbi tasted nice. Amount of duck is disappointing. Maybe the duck was living in dire poverty before being killed.  - The appetizers. The bonito was nice, seems much more japanese than Korean. I guess this harks back to the long history they shared together?  - *addon* Somyeon was the most Korean dish there. The noodles was lovely but I think they were rationing the pork belly for the tough times ahead. I counted maybe three thin coins (like fifty cent coins big and thinner than that) of pork belly?  - the bbq wagyu they served was lukewarm in certain areas and a tad cold at others, temperature-wise. The combination of flavours is very typical of any upscale dining establishment. Celeriac and wagyu. Meh.",Naeum restaurant
6099,56,4,2023-08-20,"Impressive impressive food, it is not easy to find dishes that are so well executed, the creativity and the taste profile is perfect. I like how simple is the taste yet it taste so good. Been to other restaurant which have very complex taste and of course they have 10/10 for food  This restaurant has simple but also a 10/10 if you know what I mean,  The only thing is the service , they are efficient but feels a bit rushed and at least one of them is slightly uninterested. Pardon me no one is bad here. One is stance which I remember is when I was trying to take a picture one of the witness burst out laughing, not in the standard uniform. But her service is too  Overall I'll be back there again",Naeum restaurant

Undoubtedly, every aspect of our experience ‚Äì starting from the exceptional service, and palate-pleasing flavours, right down to the captivating presentation. Among all the delectable dishes we savoured throughout our meal, it is worth mentioning that their fish dish stood out as an absolute highlight due to its succulent texture and rich taste.

Not easy to get a slot here so better mark the date when the booking opens for the day you want. There aren't many tables too. The service was excellent from start to end.

Food: a very solid 5 stars Service: 5 stars Ambience: 4.5 stars  The restaurant definitely deserves its Michelin star. The presentation of the dishes were elegant, neat, cute and most importantly pretty. The flavours are great, refreshing and interesting (e.g. the subtle tinge of sourness being able to complement the dishes very well). The red mullet norangchoksu (fish dish) had so many flavours in it, but yet they all came together perfectly. The doeji-galbi bap (bibimbap dish) looked so pretty inviting that we couldn‚Äôt bear to eat it. In addition, the hotteok (dessert with a warm piece of sticky pancake served with ice cream on top) was delicious‚Ä¶ so much so that I would have asked for a second serving if I could. We have been to various high-end restaurants, and the desserts tend to be underwhelming versus the standard of the mains in general (but this was different).  The service was also great coupled with the fact that the introduction and instructions that accompanied every dish was very clear.  Kudos to Chef Louis and his team for this impeccable experience.

This is a must visit for any foodie visiting Singapore, and was significantly better than Odette, which has boasted 3 stars for a few years.  Servers were very friendly and know their menu well, wine pairings were great and EVERY dish was incredible and balanced.

It was fully booked at noon, which is quite lively among the Michelin restaurants I've been to, and I only booked lunch two months in advance. Apart from the shrimps, the appetizers are amazing. Each dish has a strong flavor impact. Because it is a seaside theme, there are more fish. The octopus beef for the main course is very delicious. The octopus is very soft and glutinous. The three abalones. The photo just goes around the place to tell you the ingredients of the Korean bibimbap later. I like the dessert and it feels more memorable than other Michelin restaurants.

I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.  What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.  As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

I love the little touches of your own name in the menu, feels very personal. I also love sitting in front of the bustling kitchen where I can see my food being prepared.  We had wine pairings along with the signature menu. I highly recommend the signature menu where you get to have their somyeon! It‚Äôs their signature since day 1 and I can totally tell why. Their palette cleanser (not pictured) was one of the best one I had! The only thing I probably would change was to perhaps order a bottle of wine of my own liking instead of a wine pairing. Some of the food did not go well with the wine but I‚Äôm sure they might have changed it since I went there early March. Will come back! ^^",Naeum restaurant
6124,81,5,2024-06-15,"Brilliantly elevated and executed Korean fine dining. Naeum was a wonderful surprise. It took beloved and well known Korean dishes, comfort food, deconstructed them to what is essentially heartfelt and distinctive about that dish, and then reconstructed it into something entirely new yet soulfully familiar at the same time. Hearing the ideation of some of the dishes was very engaging, it felt like food nostalgia given new life for a modern palate. Even the name of the restaurant, as noted on the menu, points to the importance of evoking memories, and it reminds me of a subtle nod to Proust‚Äôs madeleine. It was really enjoyable seeing dishes and ingredients I love and recognize and eating them in new and creative ways. Also, Naeum‚Äôs exquisite somyeon was such a standout dish, I would return just to eat a whole plate of this and only this if I could. Looking forward to future episodes!",Naeum restaurant

A well rounded balance of flavours from sweet, tangy, umami and a lil spice.  Two of the hot dishes were a miss for me - the samhab dish which tasted a bit flat with the same sweet flavour across all the different types of meat and the sotbap which was a little underwhelming as it was just a lot of rice.  All the add-on dishes from the signature menu were all hits for me so I would recommend that. The lobster was memorable. Didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd enjoy the jujube dessert but it was good!

Instead of episodes based on a theme, the menu was an amalgamation of dishes from previous episodes, with the dining experience akin to listening to a playlist of best hits. Top favourites are appetisers, duck galbi, somyeon, and sanchae sotbap (rice + wagyu). Also, the charcoal jujube (ice cream) is not to be missed.

6129,86,4,2024-06-15,"Naeum is one of the more popular restaurants, and this reservation was made around 2 months in advance. We had Episode 5: Front Yard Barbeque.  The classic is priced at $198++ and the Signature at $258++  Pairings are available at $168++ for full and $98++ for half. Non-alcoholic beverages are available at $88++  The food is excellent. Everything tasted well balanced, punchy at the right times, and cohesive in theme and sequence.  However, having ordered the Signature and considering a $300 price point, I have a couple of comments: - Staff could be a bit better trained to not just memorise, but understand the cooking process and techniques - Tables are spaced too near to one another, it feels like any normal cafe - Whilst Aesop is used in the toilet, the toilet design itself is too weekend cafe like  Would I visit again?

You will only see this in mostly Michelin 3 star places where the chef might know you personally.

I visited a few months ago and wrote a review, so the interior may have changed. Some artificial trees and flowers, as well as dried ones, do not appear to be appropriate for fine dining. It would be better to change the interior.",Naeum restaurant

6162,119,3,2024-06-15,"Highly recommended restaurant. Reservation was made sometime late July for October. The service staff were attentive. As for the atmosphere, the place can rather noisy which dampen the experience. As for the food, I'm no food connoisseur, so no complaints on taste. I would say that for 2 of the servings the food did not stay intact on the plate and it was amusing to watch the dish fall apart as the waiter was explaining the course. It was brought back to the kitchen to be related. I would say it was one time visit for me.",Naeum restaurant

Some of the dishes in Episode 4 were exceptional (such as the desserts) but the others were nothing to shout about (in particular the appetisers). Portions were very small for the price (compared to other fine dining establishments). Whilst most restaurants nowadays have two seatings, the 2 hour seating and pace of the dishes being served felt a bit rushed considering the price paid.",Naeum restaurant

Each dish in essence features flavours from Korean dishes but a diff take/interpretation for example instead of the iconic beef galbi, it features duck instead. Overall, a nice experience there and dinner company were the usual suspects I adore. So can't go wrong.",Naeum restaurant

The star canape however is the Duckgalbi, a savoury duck meatball with a hidden tteok core with a crunchy outer crust which paired fine with the Dom Perignon Vintage 2012 from the wine pairing. The memorable from main was the Samhab. The rare-cut Iberico pluma was binchotan grilled to perfect doneness. If you like red date try their signature Charcoal Jujube - ¬†a scope of Jujube ice cream, ¬†well made, not overly sweet with mild flavour of jujube with puff multigrain and several ultra-crispy charcoal tuiles.

6185,142,4,2024-06-15,"Ep:1 Tucked in the corner of town where Korean BBQ spots are a dime a dozen, Nae:um is a bold foray forward, a vote of confidence for the evolution of culinary acceptance in Singapore. This is not 'Korean Royal Cuisine' (in the vein of say, ÏßÄÌôîÏûêJihwaja in Seoul), but neither is it ÏïàÏ£ºAnju (a korean term for food consumed with alcohol). Instead it is a tapestry of influences from East to West, held together by the memories of a Western-trained Korean chef, Seok Hyun, who previously worked with Sun Kim at Meta, and then helming the now-defunct Kimme.  The interior design of the space evokes a warm and homely feel, plenty of warm tones. Particularly impressive were the hanging ceiling lights shaped like logs that projected light upwards against the ceiling. It was obvious that chef wanted to showcase a range of ferments that are a hallmark of korean cuisine. The service staff were in general accommodating and attentive (especially in refilling glasses of water and clearing plates/replacing cutlery), although they struggled a little under the weight of the full house and multiple turnovers. 20 minutes had passed before we realized that we needed to 'order' food (we were seated at 820pm, so by the time we found out that nothing was being served, it was already 840pm).  Some highlights: Trio of amuse bouche Î∂ÄÍ∞ÅBugak - this is usually a deep fried vegetable or kelp coated in Ï∞πÏåÄÌíÄglutinous rice paste, and dried again. The one we got on the day was a shiso leaf. ÎàÑÎ£ΩÏßÄNurungji beef tartare - the server explained that this was inspired by Ïú°ÌöåYukhoe (a korean raw meat dish usually seasoned with salt, sugar, pepper, sesame oil and garlic), and I could appreciate the concept down to the egg yolk shavings (raw egg yolk is commonly used as a garnish in the traditional version). It would have been nice for completeness if they served Ïà≠Îäâsungnyung (scorched rice tea) at the end of the meal, since they already made ÎàÑÎ£ΩÏßÄNurungji here (this is quite a traditional practice not only in Korean cuisine but also chinese and japanese) duck galbi - a play on Îñ°Í∞àÎπÑtteok-galbi (traditionally a hand chopped meatball patty made with beef short ribs, but 'tteok' sounds like 'duck') this was the best executed of the trio, where hand-chopped duck is mixed into a patty with garlic, spring onions, ginger and Í≥†Ï∂îÏû•gochujang. This was flavourful with a hidden rice cake in the middle adding a starchy counterpoint to the salty meat  Î¨ºÌöåMulhwe (anglicized as 'Mulhwae' in Nae:um's menu): This would be raw fish in a chilled spicy broth in traditional form. Here, kanpachi is used, alongside microgreens and some fermented goodies, in a broth of yuzu, soy and mirin. This was a nicely conceived dish both visually and in terms of flavour. I would have preferred an extra hit of the gochujang but I understand that balance is a little hard to achieve and the other elements should not be overpowered.  Uni ÏÜåÎ©¥Somyeon: Best dish of the entire evening hands down - the conception is simple: buckwheat noodles, sesame and truffle oil, with white kimchi, pear, and murasaki uni. A decadent version of what is already one of my favourite korean dishes. I hope they keep this dish as a staple on the menu.  Ï∞úJjim (pronounced 'tzim' with an emphasis on the 'tz' sound): Traditionally a dish made by boiling marinated meat/seafood, this version sees a grouper fillet and zucchini-wrapped crabmeat in a beurre blanc sauce which has some ÎêúÏû•doenjang (soybean paste) in it. The sauce was great (who doesn't like beurre blanc? With or without a twist), the crabmeat with zucchini was the star, and the grouper was overcooked and disappointing (the chef de partie doing the fish may have had an off-day by his standards).  Duck with gochujang / ÎàÑÎ£©nuruk wagyu striploin (supplement +$48): There was nothing wrong with these dishes but I felt that they were a little slack in conception (compared to say, the somyeon).  Summer ÎπôÏàòbingsu: An amazing dessert, a granita of fruit with melon bits, mascarpone to add texture and weight, and an insanely addictive makgeolli ice cream. A great way to end the meal",Naeum restaurant

I was a little apprehensive at trying out a Korean restaurant as I find Korean food generally overly seasoned and salty and the natural taste of the food is lost. BUT this was definitely NOT so with chef Louis Han creations. His creations were absolutely delectable and presentation aesthetically pleasing. I love how I could enjoy the different texture of the variety of ingredients that were exquisitely put together and yet still able to taste the naturally sweetness of the individual ingredient. I like that the chef was friendly and that he took the time to interact with us. That adds another star to my rating. However, though I like the cute drawer of utensils at our table, I initially had some problem trying to take them out but that‚Äôs a minor issue.

Due to the covid restrictions (still 2 pax), the place can‚Äôt really hold a lot of people.  The menu is simple, staff is friendly. The food is nice but portion is really really small and items are quite few. The major setback  is the waiting time in between dishes, probably coz we are fast eaters and have to wait for the rest as they sync the dishes together.  Another feedback, probably we have some expectations with Korean food being hearty in portion and to an extent, some soup. Unfortunately, there wasnt a soup base to finish off or to start with.

The dishes were in general not bad at all, but I am feeling a lack of an impressive dish - the somyeon was the best dish - but most of the dishes just felt like there is a lack of innovation. As this is korean centric, there was a frequent use of gojujang, but as a result, the dishes can feel similar in taste.

Next we move to 2 cold dishes. First was mulhwae, loving how the flavours work well. Next the uni somen, I mean buckwheat noodles with uni and kimchi. What could go wrong? Nothing just 10/10. And then we have the jjim. The buerre blanc sauce that came with it was so good and the fish was perfectly cooked. Don‚Äôt forget the crab and zucchini too, sounds like a weird combo but just great. Then of course we have the duck. It took longer but it‚Äôs so worth the wait. It came with onion pur√©e, spinach, beetroot and duck jus. Felt like I could have a second serving of this. Rounding off the meal was a summer bingsu, which was perfect as it was light and refreshing. Not too heavy. And then petit fours as well. Overall, I am so glad I made the trip down.

6241,198,5,2022-06-16,"Chef Louis brought to live many of his (food) memories and elevated them through finesse and quality ingredients. I loved how many of the dishes had a surprise element which completely excited my Asian palate.  My favourites were: - Nrurngji beef tartare, such a powerful start with the flavours. Fresh and strong, with a great bite to wake those taste buds up. - Bugak, deep fried shisho and lotus roots with a dust of kimchi powder (cos I love cracker and spice anything) - Duck galbi tart, well marinated and charred, so flavourful with a nice surprise chew in the middle. It left me wanting more. - Uni somyeon, Korean buckwheat noodles cooked al dante, tossed in a dressing of white kimchi, scallion & truffle oils, topped with bafun uni. Just yums. - The star of the jjim dish was red grouper done to perfection with a pink blush in the middle. Accompanying it is a spanner crab rolled in charred Napa cabbage and zucchini. The sauce tied everything together in an umami buttery mess. Great dish! - Charcoal jujube was such a worthy add-on, reminds me of a cold, moist version of the Chinese snack Sachima. Loved the marriage of ingredients and textures which ended the meal on a lovely note.  We had a couple more add ons: - the nuruk-aged wagyu striploin was lovely, but we weren't mindblown, so maybe one to share might be a good sample. - we couldn't decide on a bottle of wine/sake, so we went for the full wine pairing. The pours went well with the dishes and ended nicely with a fruity sake with lovely melon notes :)  Special shout-out to Jay who was an amazing front-of-house. He was able to articulate not just the ingredients and process, but also Chef Louis' stories and inspiration behind the dishes. Thank you for putting the soul into the dishes and elevating our experience! After all, what's Nae:um without sense of nostalgia :)",Naeum restaurant

6243,200,5,2022-06-16,My SO & I had the pleasure of dining at Naeum on their very first day. We were not just met with impeccable service standards but also an amazing course that was carefully & thoughtfully crafted by the amazing Chef Louis.  Chef Louis brings bold new flavours and experiences that adds a whole new dimension traditional Korean cuisines while also staying true to its roots. It was something truely unique and delightful.  There is also always something exciting to look forward to with every course as Jay tells the story and meaning behind the inspiration for each dish in detail.

My fav dish of the night was the duckgalbi tart, uni somyeon, and summer bingsu. The beef tartare was awesome too. I can feel the techniques and the thoughts behind each menu. A lot of new texture and flavours were introduced in the course.  Highly recommend to check this place out. They are a new gig in town and deserve a visit. Last but not least, their service was awesome too.",Naeum restaurant
6247,0,5,2024-06-11,"Opened in 2022, this restaurant will be newly listed in the top 50 restaurants in Asia in 2024, and will be awarded one Michelin star and a green star in 2023. It is indeed worth a try. The ingredients come from Southeast Asia as much as possible, and most of them are seafood and vegetables. There is some concept of molecular gastronomy, but the dishes are distinctive and the ingredients have different flavors. I thought the portion was average, but after eating it one bite at a time, I felt so full. ‚Äã The most impressive thing was the bread, which was toasted to a rich and rich texture and served with salted butter. It seemed to be made from Johor butter. There is also dessert madeleine, which is crispy on the outside but not too sweet on the inside. It is the best in the world of madeleines. The other meals are all delicious, with a strong Southeast Asian flavor. The chef is good at using local ingredients. The rich sea area and abundant products are not always resorted to outsiders. At the same time, it is amazing. I think the Michelin Green Star is well-deserved. Return. Respect the chef's emphasis on local ingredients. Western food is eaten with an oriental soul. ‚Äã",Seroja restaurant
6248,1,5,2024-06-01,"I waited for very long to try this restaurant. Was supposed to try it before they got their Michelin star but guessed I waited too long. I have to say this is one of the best meals I have eaten here and very true to Asian taste. Visited on a weekend and was the first diner to arrive for my dinner. Was welcomed by Long and his team and he showed me around the restaurant and made me feel welcome. Once seated I was showed the menu and asked to order drinks. I asked for a recommendation for non alcoholic and was recommended the strawberry, tomato broth and genmaicha which was so unique and appetizing. Shortly after the meal started. Was very impressed with the dishes and most of them were above expectations. If you ask me the best dish, it has got to be the simplest looking Roti Puang. I never had the habit of taking carbs during fine dining and the most I get is 1-2 slices of bread but I finished the entire Roti! Can I bring some home please? All the dishes are carefully thought of and the flavours complemented each other very well. Another surprise for me was the Jasmine Tea infused duck broth which blew me away. Love the play with Asian flavours, can see a lot of familiar ones like fermented shrimp, laksa, betel leaf, bandung and milo. The stuffed chicken wing is a little expensive but definitely worth to add on as a supplement to the meal. All in all a very enjoyable meal and left me very impressed and satisfied. It's one of the rare restaurants which I have in mind to visit again! Thumbs up and highly recommended and kudos to Chef Kevin and his team. Such meticulous service where the chef actually thanked me for visiting and walked me to the door!",Seroja restaurant

You can tell that every detail is meticulously taken care of, from the food and tableware to other often overlooked elements. Every staff member is incredibly friendly and professional. The wine pairing is also excellent. Most restaurants will simply tell you what the wine is, but here, they provide detailed information about the wine's origin, geography, and climate‚Äîvery professional.

6264,17,2,2024-03-17,"I made a reservation in advance for lunch for two persons. When I made the reservation, the regular lunch menu was priced at 218++ SGD per person, as displayed on the website, without any mention of special pricing for Valentine‚Äôs Day. One day prior to our reservation, I received a notification indicating that there would be a special menu available. Still no mention of any special pricing.  While we enjoyed the food and found the combinations of flavors to be original and pleasing, we were disappointed with the service. Despite the restaurant's Michelin star reputation, the atmosphere in the crowded open kitchen was hectic, which was not exactly relaxing. Additionally, the staff's English pronunciation made it difficult for us to understand the dishes being served.  Our disappointment peaked when we received the check and discovered that the price of the lunch had increased to whopping 328++ SGD per person due to it being Valentine‚Äôs Day. We were surprised by this, as there had been no mention of a price increase when we made the booking, and no prices were displayed on the menu in the restaurant. While the waiter pointed out that this information was available on the website, it had not been present at the time of our booking. We were not informed of the price change upon entering the restaurant.  Despite our concerns, we opted to pay the check to avoid causing a scene in front of the other guests and staff.

6269,22,2,2024-02-16,"Was quite excited to visit Seroja after all the hype surrounding its opening. Eventually made my way there to celebrate my birthday with family and was left rather disappointed. The food was good. But it wasn‚Äôt great. It lacked the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that meals of this ilk ought to evoke. The canap√©s were creative enough, especially the duck with sambal hijau. The tuna with ginger kerabu for the first course was good, but nothing special and set the tone for the rest of the meal. The second course was fish, the presentation of which was somewhat lacking as it consisted of all-beige tones and lacked colour. The dish, again, tasted good with the fish being well-cooked and the sauce adding a bit of spice. The third course was a scallop in sort of laksa sauce. The best dish out of a rather middling menu. Then came the main course. The moment it was laid out before me, I recognised the style of plating. Meta does (or did, not too sure as I haven‚Äôt visited since they moved) the exact same plating for their main of Korean bbq. I opted for beef short ribs over the lamb. Short ribs were very well cooked. But again, the fact that the plating seemed to be copied and all the elements of the dish could be found down the road at Arab Street for far cheaper left me sorely disappointed. When you want to showcase a cuisine in a fine-dining format, you need to elevate the ingredients and the traditional dishes. This elevation should not only involve a change from cheaper beef to more expensive alternatives. Rather, it needs to be demonstrated in the chef‚Äôs level of finesse. Desserts and palate cleansers were ok. Their bahulu was completely average. Once again, the chef seems to have confused elevation with using premium ingredients. A home-cook can opt to use Wagyu instead of regular beef to make a burger patty. That alone, however, does not elevate the burger that the cook is making.  VERDICT: Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Clearly the people singing praises of this restaurant have not gone down the road to eat malay food or have never tasted it. Where the Michelin guide is concerned, it‚Äôs understandable that they‚Äôd be so easily enamoured as they‚Äôre French and haven‚Äôt gone down to Geylang to eat proper malay cuisine. Priced at $218 for lunch, you‚Äôd be better off dining at other, more creative, Michelin-starred establishments like Sommer or Poise or even Nouri which has started it‚Äôs lunch specials at $68++.",Seroja restaurant

It‚Äôs hard to pick a favorite dish from the Nusantara Menu as it‚Äôs planned so well that they all complement one another in flavor and substance. The jasmine tea duck broth was very welcome as a light but flavorful break after many heavy hitters. While the BBQ duck percik that followed was delicious, I actually really liked the traders‚Äô rice that accompanied it.  I was also impressed by the presence & effort of both the co-founder and head chef, and clearly the team are inspired to respect hard work & attention to detail.

However, they will send you a text message to confirm your reservation a few days before the meal is scheduled, and will also give you detailed instructions on how to get there. The service is very considerate. When I walked in, I was a little surprised at first. The main dining seats are around the open kitchen, and it feels like studying by yourself at the stainless steel dining table. The privacy is average, but it is friendly for taking photos of food, and the background is very clean. The entire menu is full of Southeast Asian style, with a distinct Malay flavor. Seroja means ""lotus"" in Malay, so there are quite a lot of flowers and Malay ingredients used in the entire menu. Chef Kevin is also Malaysian and the winner of the 2023 Michelin young chef award. Throughout the meal, you can witness him leading a team of 7 chefs busy in the kitchen. As time goes by, the kitchen goes from quiet to noisy and back to quiet, which is also a sense of ritual in itself. The overall taste is more in line with Asian tastes. Personally, the best ones are the lamb chops as the main course (I also paid extra for steak, but it was not as delicious as the lamb chops) and the scallops (the sauce is very special) And the bread that goes with the meal (fried and then baked, it was so delicious that two people ate it all). What‚Äôs more interesting is that you can see that they put the Michelin man in the corner of the kitchen shelf, literally putting it on the shelf, haha.

6309,62,4,2023-07-21,"The flavours and use of diverse ingredients were truly amazing and impressive! Enjoyed most dishes very much, special shout-out for the desserts because they were incredible AND SO DELICIOUS; although the finesse in presentation could be improved (relative to other one Michelin starred restaurants).  The lowlight however are the proteins used for the mains. The kinmedai was perfectly cooked - making the low quality of the fish itself even more apparent, because the meat itself was bland and lacklustre requiring more sauce to make the fish palatable.  The duck was also tough, tasted overcooked (texture wise was quite rough and off) - not silky soft and tender as you would expect. At this price point and comparing to other one Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore, you would expect better care in churning out and sourcing the best quality protein for their main dish. Thankfully this was somewhat saved again by the flavourful sauces which were exceptional.  The bread was SOOO crispy and good - I honestly would have appreciated a side of butter or more sauce given on the side for it because on its own it was bland and most of the dishes had limited sauce (although we did ask for more); a bit stressful to ration out some sauce for the bread each time. Either that or perhaps flavour the inside of the bread as well?  The service was quite lacking and messy  which is a bit disappointing for the price. It took a while for the concierge to realise my presence and bring me to my seat. And after a while it took them forever also to take our drink orders or welcome us to start the course with us repeatedly trying to get their attention. Also they served the wrong water and topped up wrongly (still vs sparkling).",Seroja restaurant

6312,65,5,2023-07-21,One of the best meals we recently had. Enjoy every single dish. The presentation was great. Full of flavours. Super worth it! Come and try.  Service is very attentive. Would consider coming back for new menu or dinner.,Seroja restaurant
6313,66,5,2023-07-21,An overall fantastic experience.  I was warmly greeted at the door by one of the co-founders but had to use the restroom before being seated and one of he kindly walked me all the way to the restroom himself (a great sign of service that often gets overlooked but one I appreciated).  As I was seated at the table the staff were very attentive to our needs and the modern and inviting open concept interior design of the restaurant was very pleasant.  The courses were well thought out and executed and I appreciate that we had various team members explain each course to us with a smile. All the courses were as one would expect delightfully delicious.  We had some natural wines to pair which was fantastic.  Overall a great experience and a well deserved one Michelin star. Kudos to the team.,Seroja restaurant
6314,67,5,2023-07-21,Spent our eldest son‚Äôs birthday at Seroja as a surprise and we weren‚Äôt disappointed!

6316,69,5,2024-06-15,"Seroja opened right after the end of the Covid pandemic, and it has remained surprisingly under the radar even until now. A friend of mine who lives in the same building for years, did not even knew about this place until i told him. The dishes are very Javanese and Malay inspired with abit of the usual Japanese, French and even Chinese thrown in, which is strange considering that the head chef and sous chef were from Korean inspired Meta Restaurant before. But somehow they were able to pull it off and even over delivered. This is actually the first time i have tried this type of food in a fine dining setting and me and my group were very impressed. Not only were the dishes good, but the drink pairing too, especially the non alcoholic pairing. Every drink complemented each dish and somehow enhance the dish to a higher level. There was no kombucha, but just  combinations of fruits and spices with special techniques. Service was great and we also got to meet the owner who was on deck serving and chatting with all customers along with this team. Location can be quite hard to find when walking from the carpark. Its entrance is facing the inner garden courtyard of DUO. Unfortunately no toilet in the restaurant. You gotta walk out to use the mall toilet. I am not surprised if they will soon get their Michelin star. Tip: do not finish the bread even though it is really delicious. Keep it to soak up the sauces from later dishes.",Seroja restaurant
6317,70,4,2024-06-15,"Tried the lunch menu and really enjoyed it. Chef Kevin and team elevate familiar flavours from the Malay archipelago with french cooking techniques and modern plating.  Standout dishes include the crunchy skinned kinmedai fish with a highly delicious bone broth/ sauce, and the kesum/podi sauces mopped up with the brioche-looking roti paung (the Hokkaido scallop itself was strangely unremarkable).  While not every dish quite hits the mark yet, Seroja does a great job at challenging your expectations and tastebuds of what is Malaysian/Indonesian food, and is well worth a visit. Kudos also for the super warm and friendly service people, thank you!",Seroja restaurant

6327,80,5,2024-06-15,"I could wax lyrical about Seroja all day and I just might. The team has crafted a menu that is both thoughtful and sublime, using ingredients that shine light on hidden beauty of the archipelago. There are no airs or pretensions about their cuisine ‚Äì each course was masterfully executed, with careful thought of every single component, but not once did it feel like ‚Äúshowmanship‚Äù. Rather, there is a sincerity to everything that they make. Their drinks are also divine ‚Äì we had the non-alcoholic pairing and adored every drink, and the sommelier picked out two delicious wines for us as well.  The entire team was an absolute pleasure to chat with throughout the meal ‚Äì everyone was bright and cheerful, patiently explaining every dish and drink to us. As we were celebrating a friend‚Äôs graduation, they even sent us a wonderful dessert to sweeten our already amazing meal.  I cannot recommend Seroja enough.

6329,82,2,2024-06-15,"Disappointed with the chicken wings - was nowhere near as good as what the server made it out to be. It was tasteless, soggy, tiny, and for the price ($25++ each for each 6cm wing), it was a rip-off. Our table had 6 people and we provided feedback to 4 different service staff who said that they passed on the feedback to the chef, who didn't even make an effort to check in on our table although another staff told us he would make his rounds. We were still charged the full price of $100++ for 4 terrible wings, which is exorbitant. As for the rest of the food, we enjoyed some dishes and others were mediocre.",Seroja restaurant
6330,83,5,2024-06-15,"A new rising star in town  The service is unsurprisingly top notch given the price point and the ambiance is clean, sharp, and well thought out.

I think the pictures will do a better job than any description here would do so please take a look.",Seroja restaurant
6331,84,1,2024-06-15,A self-righteous one! The service staff are not polite in the restaurant! The food was not fresh when we questioned it.

6333,86,5,2024-06-15,"Visited in Apr 2023  A brilliant overall dining experience where every dish brings a different taste. The menu is very well crafted with various Southeast Asian and contemporary flavours. Right from the starting dishes to the desserts, the preparation and presentation is top notch. The portion sizes are just right. I liked quite a few dishes and it‚Äôs very difficult to single out which one was the best. The beef ‚Äòmain course‚Äô (if one may call it so) was particularly good in combination with the rice and sides. Among the desserts, really liked the bahulu (traditional Malay pastry). I really don‚Äôt think there was a dish after which I thought that I did not enjoy it, which is very rare in any tasting menu meal.  I did not take the wine or non-alcoholic pairing, but just ordered a couple of non-alcoholic drinks. I would recommend people to definitely try out the Pomegranate & Mulberries with curry leaves drink. It was fantastic in my view.  Service was excellent.  Keep it up Seroja team. You folks are fantastic.  A definite recommendation for SG residents/visitors.",Seroja restaurant
6334,87,5,2024-06-15,"An inspiring dining experience that reflects the culinary pride the Chef and team has in their (and mine!) local cuisine. While Malay cuisine is typically served unassumingly in large hearty portions, Seroja is intentional in the presentation of each ingredient, the taste profiles, and the interplay of textures in each dish, making it an undoubtedly elevated experience.  The non alcoholic beverage pairing amped up the experience by two notches in the daring deconstructions of savoury dishes as beverages, and how beautifully they also pair with each course.  Definitely a strong contender to watch in the recent advent and rise of Asian fine dining.",Seroja restaurant

6338,91,5,2024-06-15,Made a reservation for Seroja because I heard good things about them and I just wanted a nice meal after some crazy days at work.  This is really one of the better meals I had in recent months and I think the prices are reasonable for someone who wants to get into fine dining. The starters were amazing and the standout dishes for me were the scallop and roti paung as well as traders rice with beef. Loved some of the wine pairing as well.  Highly recommend this to people who are sick and tired of Japanese or French fine dining and just want to try something different.,Seroja restaurant

6341,94,5,2024-06-15,"This restaurant was one of the most unique dining experiences we have been able to have in Singapore.  Seroja is a restaurant located in Duo Galleria (near Bugis MRT) that specializes in upscale dishes inspired by the diverse food cuisine in the Malaysian peninsula. The style of the restaurant is set so that you‚Äôre able to view the entire kitchen operation in front of you‚Äîit was inspiring to see how smoothly the team worked together and were able to coordinate to produce a dinner for us!  Overall, the highlight of the meal was definitely the bread and pastries provided. We were also blown away by how they were able to use common ingredients in Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine and uplift them with striking presentation and flavor quality. The chefs also sometimes came up personally to serve us and describe the courses, which was helpful and interesting.  Overall, I don‚Äôt think you would find a fine dining menu set out as uniquely as Seroja asides from Singapore. We‚Äôd highly recommend a visit!",Seroja restaurant

6348,101,5,2024-06-15,"A young restaurant which deserves more visits. The scallop course was exceptional, both in the quality of ingredients and the sauces. The bread had a wonderful chew, and I ate far more than I should have. The coconut in the kurma dessert was beautiful.  But there were also some areas of improvement. The kerabu was too dominantly sweet, and didn‚Äôt evoke the taste profile of the kerabus I‚Äôm used to. The chocolate cake was too salty. The lunch menu could use one more piece of protein, since the soup, egg custard, and noodle dishes didn‚Äôt really have any significantly sized protein to give a textural chew.  But those are niggles that can be fixed. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what else the team dreams up.",Seroja restaurant

Seroja, imho, is one of best new spots where I love the originality Chef Kevin has brought to the table. A mishmash of the cuisines from the Malay Archipelago, I loved every dish (minus the only one goat cheese dessert) but more so, every single sauce that Chef Kevin paired with the main ingredient of every dish. They were all so well cooked, well balanced, complex and best of all - refreshingly different.

6378,8,1,2024-06-15,"I must say, my recent visit to here just now was rather disappointing. While enjoying our meal, the ambiance was shattered when the staff started sweeping the floors around us. Not only was it distracting, but it also gave off an impression of poor timing and lack of consideration for the diners. It's disheartening to see such a disregard for customer experience. Adding to restaurant the already underwhelming experience , the staff's behavior further detracted from our meal. As we were trying to select our dishes, a staff member stood nearby, rearranging dishes on a nearby counter, making us feel rushed and uncomfortable. It's crucial for restaurant staff to be attentive to the needs of their customers, rather than creating an atmosphere of pressure and intrusion. It's unfortunate to note that even during the prime dining hours, seems more focused on closing up shop than catering to their customers. Rushing to clean the restaurant an hour before the official closing time at 10 PM is not only discourteous but also disrupts the dining experience for other patrons. It's essential for restaurants to uphold their advertised hours and prioritize customer satisfaction until the very end of service. To make matters worse, during our meal, we encountered yet another inconvenience. As we attempted to enjoy our drinks, we were informed by the staff that the ice had run out. This oversight demonstrates a lack of preparation and attention to detail on the part of the restaurant's management. It's unacceptable for such a basic necessity to be unavailable during service hours. Is a bad experience for us,  I hope the management addresses these issues.",Zhang Liang - Bugis

Meat was super hard to chew for both choices. Disappointed.  Honest opinion - the competitor Yang Guo Fu offers much better quality malatang. broth at the other side is much more authentic and not salty.

Pick up your favorite ingredients in a salad bowl in advance and present them to the cashier. The price will be determined after checking what is inside. Tell the type of soup (or you can choose yakisoba type (dry) without soup) and spiciness at the register. This time, I chose the ""spicy soup"" that was recommended by the member I went with. Since it was my first time, I didn't have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe amount of ingredients, so I ended up taking a little too much. In the end, it ended up costing me about $23, but I managed to finish it all.

Why I‚Äôm particular about it, as I‚Äôm not sure if the bowl has been taken out of the weight (tare weight) or counted in. Some ingredients are soaked in water so naturally some water (when picking item) do add to the weight(which I‚Äôm still okay) Hope the seller can go read up on Singapore requirements on NEA or Weights & Measure office.

We then went to the counter to ask them about it. The lady at the counter checked our receipt, and asked us what types of meat we ordered. Apart from sounding totally unapologetic and rude, she proceeds to ask for the bowl of food to be brought to the counter, to inspect if there is absolutely no meat inside. the staff, then said she will check the kitchen if our ‚Äúmeat‚Äù was being left unattended. there was no response from them, which we had to approach them a second time before the staff asked us to go and take the meat ourselves.  As i walked to get a new bowl to take the meat (like how most mala places are self-service), the staff came and took over the bowl - she asked which type of meat we took, then took the same types for us before taking it behind to be cooked. I did not control how much she took, merely stated the types.  When the food was ready she waved me over to come to the counter and collect it myself. When I got there, she pointedly told me that the quantity of ‚Äúnew‚Äù meat cooked for us exceeded the original amount we were charged for and not given. Then told me ‚Äú‰ª•ÂêéÂ¶ÇÊûúÊúâËøôÊ†∑ÔºåÈ©¨‰∏äËØ¥ÔºåÊàë‰ª¨ÊâçÂèØ‰ª•ÂéªÂé®ÊàøÊãø‰Ω†‰ª¨ÁöÑËÇâ„ÄÇÁé∞Âú®ÔºåËÇâÁªô‰Ω†Â§ö‰∫Ü.""  Don‚Äôt worry mdm, ‰∏ç‰ºöÊúâ‰ª•Âêé‰∫Ü. (we left the extra $3 or wtv u gave us in the bowl, shown in the pic. just so we‚Äôre clear that we didn‚Äôt take advantage of you). Firstly, SHE took the meat herself from the meat counter, NOT US, and we didn‚Äôt in any way control the amount she took. With the way she grabbed the bowl and sped through the meat counter, how were we supposed to keep track of and ensure the exact same number of grams of meat was taken?  Let me just clarify, we weren‚Äôt upset about the mistake of leaving out our meat at all. But the error here is in how it was handled - completely bad customer service throughout, not a single apology, and worst, implying that we were trying to take advantage of them and cheat them of their meat.  Would have given a zero star if we could, but google reviews doesn‚Äôt allow that.  PS. throughout the whole process, there wasn‚Äôt an apology at all",Zhang Liang - Bugis

6651,281,1,2022-06-16,"The waiter's attitude was very bad just because he brought the wrong condiment bowl (the condiment table was in a mess, and the waiter took the bowl out from underneath later)",Zhang Liang - Bugis

6653,283,5,2022-06-16,"The soup was surprisingly creamy! Not milk-creamy, but creamy in that they use quality broth as the soup base. I usually order ""mild  spicy"" but because I was sharing with my friends, went for ""medium spicy"". Medium was manageable. Measured by weight and due to it's location, was a little pricey. But I would still recommend because the food was delicious!",Zhang Liang - Bugis

6657,287,1,2022-06-16,Ordered close to $20 and was given a super small container for takeaway. Obviously no soup left when I‚Äôm home. Told the staff my concern and he just ignored. Bad service. Would not recommend here at all.,Zhang Liang - Bugis

6661,291,5,2021-06-16,"Ordered thru foodpanda for self pick up. Service is great . The Taiwanese/ Mainland Chinese male staff is very courteous and helpful.  Soup wise , it tasted great and not too spicy. It does taste more creamy than the usual Ma la tang .  Price is very reasonable. The restaurant itself looks very clean and comfortable though I did not dine in . Would definitely come back again",Zhang Liang - Bugis
6662,292,1,2021-06-16,My mouth was so numb that I was dancing. The taste of the food itself was completely covered up. It was so-so.,Zhang Liang - Bugis
