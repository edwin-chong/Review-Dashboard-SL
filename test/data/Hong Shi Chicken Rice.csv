5,2024-06-25,Nice chicken rice with tender meat and tasty rice! Good enough to make me return again.
3,2022-06-26,"I would describe this as a decent neighbourhood chicken rice stall. Meat pieces are all moist and tender. The soy-based sauce elevates the taste of the chicken and lends flavour to the rice. Rice is cooked well and is evidently fried before cooking. The chilli is a little lacking though - it has a fair consistency that clings well enough without over coating. However, i found it too salty, not spicy enough and not well rounded.  Additional rice is available at $0.50."
